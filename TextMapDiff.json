It is both the door and the lock that guards it, cleaving the past from the future like a sharp ax.\\n\\nDuring this month, people will discard objects that bear bonds (such as keepsakes from past lovers or deceased family members), declare that they are severing the past, and step forth into the future \u2014 this act is completely voluntary.\\n\\nSecond month \u2014 Month of Balance\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Scale of Justice, Talanton\\nThe most disciplined of all months, Kephale uses its measurements to dictate the months. During this month, people's daily routines will become more consistent, their moods even, and they are more willing to pass judgment and sign contracts as a result.\\n\\nIt is said that when there was day and night in the past, the Month of Balance was the only month when the days were as long as nights, because Talanton managed to mediate a truce between Oronyx and Aquila.\\n\\nThird Month \u2014 Month of Evernight\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Veil of Time, Oronyx\\nA month when the sun's shine is dimmer than usual. People doze off more frequently, and their instincts and emotions replace their thought and reason, making it hard to accomplish intricate tasks.\\nIt is said that in the past, this month's nights were longer than its days, for Oronyx triumphed over Aquila for undisputed authority over the sky.\\n\\n<size=28>Pillar Season</size>\\nFourth Month \u2014 Month of Cultivation\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Pillar of Stone, Georios\\nThe month of spring cultivation, also the busiest month. During this month, the earth is restored into a state most suited for farming. People till the soil, sow the seeds, and offer labor as tribute to the land. Dromases will also be doubly vigorous.\\n\\nFifth Month \u2014 Month of Joy\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Chalice of Plenty, Phagousa\\nThe month when spring cultivation ends. During this month, spring waters flow, and fishermen flourish. The heaviest workload for the year ended last month, and everyone is reveling in the atmosphere of festivity. This is the best month for brewing and holding celebrations, when people wake up, massage their temples in a daze, then shake their heads and go back to sleep.\\n\\nSixth Month \u2014 Month of Everday\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Eye of Twilight, Aquila\\nThe hottest month, when the Dawn Device shines even more brightly than usual. The land's flora also works hard to absorb its shine so that people can have a good harvest. Bathed in this radiance, people will feel refreshed and vitalized.\\nIt is said that in the past, this month's days were longer than its nights, for Aquila triumphed over Oronyx for undisputed authority over the sky.\\n\\n<size=28>Creation Season</size>\\nSeventh Month \u2014 Month of Freedom\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Throne of Worlds, Kephale\\nThe month of tranquil peace. There are no major events to attend, nor significant tasks to complete. During this month, people can work on their hobbies, pursue their dreams, and do whatever they wish to do. Just as Kephale created the world, it also allowed its inhabitants to play in its courtyard.\\n\\nEighth Month \u2014 Month of Reaping\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Bough of Rift, Cerces\\nThe month of the fall harvest. Crops absorbed the light during the Month of Everday, and have grown into their ripest. Similar to the Month of Cultivation, people are busier than usual this month.\\n\\nNinth Month \u2014 Month of Weaving\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Chrysalis of Gold, Mnestia\\nThe month when the fall harvest is completed. During this month, people will reminisce on their experiences over the year. Mnestia collects everything and weaves them into golden threads of memory. This is a month of family gatherings to enjoy the good times. Leisurely individuals will be weaving at home, and weaving-related festivals will be held this month.\\n\\n<size=28>Calamity Season</size>\\nTenth Month \u2014 Month of Strife\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Lance of Fury, Nikador\\nThe first month after production activities are completed. People are liberated from the most important tasks of each year, resulting in surplus labor in society. In the past, the cities typically waged war at this time. This month is also the period when criminal executions and burning offerings in prayer to the gods occur.\\n\\nEleventh Month \u2014 Month of Mourning\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Hand of Shadow, Thanatos\\nThe month when the cities would gradually fall silent. Wars usually approach their end during this month. People would drag bodies back from the battlefields, bury the dead, and comfort the living. Priests are the busiest this month, for they need to pray for the dead. The mood of this month is one of grave somberness. People would gradually lessen their activities during this time, as if in slumber as well.\\n\\nTwelfth Month \u2014 Month of Fortune\\n<b>Patron Titan</b>: Coin of Whimsy, Zagreus\\nThe last month of the year. The previously silent masses would start up their liveliness once more, and good and bad things would start to happen more frequently. Gamblers believe that this month brings them good fortune, and opportunistic merchants look forward to sudden spikes in wealth. Thieves would typically have exhausted their savings, and rub their hands together for the next job. The Month of Fortune is the most tumultuous month for law enforcement.\\n\\nDue to Zagreus' unpredictable nature, the number of days in this month can never be confirmed. Sometimes, when you should turn the page at the end of the calendar, a leap day appears at the end of it like a ghost.

Just like those resplendent years untouched by strife, white iron and bronze were originally ritual offerings to gods. It was only later that they were cast off from altars and melted into armaments, becoming even more fearsome metals than gold.\\n\\nThe dragon in the story has been subjugated, right...?

Only Cerces has the answer to these questions.\\n\\nBut, compared to those Titans themselves, these stone mounds are much more stable \u2014 they don't roll around in foul mire, nor do they sow chaos for sheer pleasure. Also, sheesh, this thing used to fly in the sky, causing the earliest Georios craftsmen to laud its \"potential\" when they laid eyes on it. After an arduous process of soul reforging and intent transference, this Thief's Hand was crafted.\\n\\nThe only hair-pulling issue with it was that the stone control panel was so heavy. It could only be refined in the city, and had to be transported out upon completion. What else could be done? We had to spend thousands of Balance Coins to rent a dromas just to transport it. And when we got there, those lumbering lug nuts couldn't even fit through the ruins gate. We'd be kicked away by them if we tried to force them through the gate.

If it was some other ordinary person, even if he memorized the procedure like the back of his hand, getting this up and running may still have been a tough feat. But even if you're an exemplar, you'd still need to memorize the following instructions well, or between the Thief's Hand and yourself, one of you would surely end up damaged.\\n\\nThere are two parts to this operational stone platform. The first is the platform itself \u2014 there are several bumps on the surface that can be pressed down. Their respective functions are forward, backward, and... other very intricate functions. They'll be introduced in the upcoming chapters.\\n\\nThe other part is this ball. Usually embedded in the platform, it will hover when activated. When you are using it, place it in your hand and hold it like you would an egg, then rotate it, and the Thief's Hand will follow suit.\\n\\nSounds simple, yeah? But you can't just focus on the stone platform, you have to keep your eyes on the Thief's Hand. You'll know how hard it is once you use it, especially those who use photostones in the city. Letting them mess about with the controls is no different from scattering a swathe of dirt across the platform \u2014 a dromas dragging its tongue across the controls will do better than them.\\n\\nThere was someone who confidently thought they had the chops and wanted to give it a try. The result? As expected, it was like that person had some grudge against the West, knocking down six walls with the hand, and almost broke it. It was such a mess that even Zagreus would have second-hand embarrassment. And they didn't even want to admit it either, saying the controls were not meant for humans.\\n\\nNonsense. That hand was made by a Titan \u2014 if it wasn't for Georios' craftsmen, ordinary mortals wouldn't even be able to lay a finger on this divine relic.\\n\\nI warn you again: Be extremely careful when controlling it. We only have this one hand, there's no one else who can make it.\\n\\n<b><size=28>Troubleshooting</size></b>\\nSometimes, it doesn't obey commands and starts acting insane. You're also sure you haven't been drinking ambrosia on the job, and Thanatos hasn't set their sights on you. Don't worry, this problem is inherent, even the craftsmen can't explain it.\\n\\nThere's nothing you can do to fix it either. It was made by Zagreus, after all.\\n\\nThere are a few solutions:\\n1. Wait for it to settle down.\\n2. Or, use any hard material as a tool and gouge an opening in the hand, then pour golden blood into it. After a few hours, the hand should be as dexterous as new.\\n<b>Additional note: I mean the Thief's Hand, not your own hand.</b>\\n\\n<b><size=28>Appendix</size></b>\\nAll right, that's the end of the beginner's chapter. You only have an inkling of its basic controls, though. For practical application, you'll need to thoroughly review the entire manual several times over.\\n\\nYou must be thinking that you understood nothing from all of the above \u2014 why not just read the second half of the manual?\\n\\nThat won't do. By Janus, that's the whole point of being a \"beginner\" \u2014 taking things one step at a time.\\n\\nBut I get your frustration \u2014 you want some consolation, don't you?

    "-262381047": "(...)\\n\\nIn Amphoreus, people employ many rituals to honor the world's cornerstone \u2014 the Pillar of Stone, Georios. One of the most important ceremonies is the mysterious Georios ritual performed annually in the city of Akashic. This ceremony comprises two parts: the Revival Ritual in the {RUBY_B#Fourth Month}Month of Cultivation{RUBY_E#} and the Harvest Ritual in the {RUBY_B#Eighth Month}Month of Reaping{RUBY_E#}.\\n\\nLegend has it that in the advent of the Era Bellica, with the birth of death, caducity, sickness, and starvation also swept across the lands. In a bid for survival, humanity began their relentless exploitation of nature with their hunting and gathering. Enraged by this foolishness, Cerces meted divine punishment. Plants began to wither, and men, in desperation, fought one another like wild beasts for base domination. Georios deeply loved all creatures on the earth, implored Cerces to give humanity another chance \u2014 if they could overcome their own avarice, life would once again return to the lands.\\n\\nGeorios bade their mole follower to steal the last apple from the humans' bag, and led them to a golden wheat field. The masses saw food, and quickly trampled all over the field in their frenzied efforts to occupy it. Only a priest of Georios ignored the people's mockery, leaving behind a single handful of wheat seeds. He offered a prayer to the lands, and proceeded to plant them. This act placated Cerces' rage, allowing humanity to continue their existence.\\n\\nThe humans erected a temple to Georios over the place where the first handful of wheat seeds were planted, and built the city of Akashic around the temple. During the Month of Reaping, acolytes from all over would deliver their first handful of wheat to this temple \u2014 a token of gratitude to this great Titan.\\n\\nIt is said that when he buried the wheat seeds, that priest mimicked the act of a mole burrowing into the earth, to loosen up the soil and prepare it for cultivation. This is why, on the eighth day of the Revival Ritual during the Month of Cultivation, the moment when families experience the {RUBY_B#Dawn}Entry Hour{RUBY_E#}, they will go to the wild fields to gather a handful of soft dirt. After that, they will cleanse the soil of impurities, place them in a clay container and enshrine it in their homes \u2014 to pray for a bountiful harvest that year.\\n\\nAfter that, with the help of others, the priest would dig up a pre-made clay effigy of Georios previously buried at an appointed spot. This was meant to symbolize the awakening of the Titan of Earth, so that all life could be revived and flourish once more. At the moment of the {RUBY_B#Morning}Lucid Hour{RUBY_E#}, people would gather at the city gate, and the procession would follow behind the dromas pulling the effigy along, all the way to the temple at the heart of the city, where they would perform prayers at the ritual.\\n\\nAnd on the fourth day of the Harvest Ritual during the Month of Reaping, Georios disciples and priests from the cities across Amphoreus will gather in Akashic. When the {RUBY_B#Noon}Action Hour{RUBY_E#} reaches its first quarter, a grand harvest festival will be held at the temple's plaza, with participants singing, dancing, and feasting. This revelry will continue until the {RUBY_B#Evening}Parting Hour{RUBY_E#} reaches its fifth quarter. As the feast comes to a head, the priests will each hold a single ear of wheat, perform their prayers to the statue of Georios in the temple and offer the wheat to the altar. This is to symbolize the lesson of the past that should never be forgotten, as well as to give thanks to Georios' act of asking forgiveness on behalf of humanity from Cerces.\\n\\n(...)",

    "-1472234621": "Rain falls from the sky. It gathers into rivers and flows into the sea. If that is the case, do the sky-blotting raindrops belong to Aquila's sky or Phagousa's ocean? As one of the most enduring topics in the debates at the forum, this question has yet to have a conclusive answer.\\n\\nRegarding the ownership of rain, the theory that we are most familiar with is the primordial theory. Phagousa's priests cite the classics, finding attribution from the creation epics of the Titans' origins. During the Era Luminosa, Aquila and Phagousa spawned from the Pillar of Stone, born of Georios' breath. From that moment on, the ocean and earth have been locked in eternal odds. Phagousa, despised by Georios, could not descend upon the earth. Thus, they wandered between heaven and earth, turning into inextinguishable rain. It wasn't till Talanton's intervention that the brewing pool named ocean was created on this land. Thus, from the beginning, the rain was a phenomenon that was under Phagousa's realm of governance.\\n\\nIn response to this argument, scholars of the Grove of the Muses put forth the Fruit Thesis as a counter-argument. To view the rain as Phagousa's brethren was but one perspective \u2014 all of Amphoreus' water, the finest wine in a cup to the rivers in the valley, were all part of the divine object that was the Chalice of Plenty. Even if raindrops would fall from the clouds, it was because they had mistakenly entered Aquila's divine realm in a drunken stupor, and would soon find themselves driven out from the skies by Aquila's enraged, thundering lance.\\n\\nWith this reasoning, any matter containing water would be part of Phagousa. Ripened fruits also contain tasty juices. Therefore, the fruits on trees were also part of Phagousa. But even a three-year-old child from Castrum Kremnos would know that the fruits of the earth are gifts from the Bough of Rift. Thus, the proposition that rain was part of Phagousa was highly contradictory.\\n\\nThe rain in the sky was a part of Aquila, absorbed by flora, thus becoming the offspring of Cerces. If any body of water was a part of Phagousa, it would surely take responsibility for the black tide that was devouring the world.\\n\\nAmong the many debates, there was no shortage of sophistry. Gordicus, a sage active during the Era Bellica, once declared in a public debate that rain should be a part of Mnestia's divine being.\\n\\nIn the rain, people can still see the sky, the earth, and the ocean, but none have seen butterflies fluttering in the rain. When butterflies appear, the rain does not. When rain appears, butterflies vanish without a trace. One could posit that rain and butterflies were two halves of a whole, and that the golden butterfly symbolized Mnestia. The rain equally patters down on all that exist, causing cold and illness in both humans and beasts, but it only nourishes flora \u2014 lifeforms protected by Cerces. This inversely also proves that Mnestia, as Cerces' companion, nourishes its lover's body in the form of rain.\\n\\nGordicus' eloquence at the forum left many sages without retort. His destiny also took a turn with this event. After being exiled on successive charges of blasphemy by the nine cities, the proud sage fell by the coast and died in a huge downpour. It is said that returning fishermen saw countless sirens roiling up huge waves, carrying the lifeless Gordicus away with the tide. They said that Phagousa was angered by this prideful sage, and turned his soul into a fish, keeping him by her side as a jester for all eternity.\\n\\nSince the world still functions normally, the roles of the many Titans governing it must be distinct. But our wisdom is less than that of even a leaf in a forest \u2014 it is only natural that we cannot fathom the truth that constitutes Amphoreus. Only those who acknowledge their own ignorance, questioning it with humility, will be able to inch towards Cerces' logic. Gordicus' tale serves as a cautionary reminder for future generations.",

In this world shrouded by eternal night, though we may not lay eyes on the starry sky, Janusopolis' astrology arts passed down to us will be the bridge that connects us to the Titans' will.\\n\\nRemember, true astrology is not mere inference of the celestial, but insight into the laws of how the world works, and perceiving the signs that the Titans left behind.\\n\\n<i>*A line of crooked characters \u2014 from the ink's color, it appears to have been added in recent years: *</i>\\n<i>!!!

Aunarch Palace \u2014 Mnestia\\n<unbreak>11</unbreak>. Trickery Palace \u2014 Zagreus\\n<unbreak>12</unbreak>. Death Palace \u2014 Thanatos\\nEach Palace represents the Titan's authority among their order, influencing all facets of the world. When we divine, we must calculate the positions and strengths of each Heavenly Palace to forecast how the Titan's will manifests.\\n\\n<align=\"center\"><size=28>Chapter 2: Astrology Calculation</size></align>\\nI know that our readers all hail from the Eternal City of Okhema \u2014 it is enveloped in the radiance of the Dawn Device, preventing us from witnessing the stars. Nonetheless, this does not mean that the art of astrology has lost its meaning. On the contrary, the Dawn Device's operational principle has provided us with a new foundation of calculation.\\n\\nTo perform astrology forecasts, we must first observe the Dawn Device's changes in light. Note down the brightest and dimmest moments in the light, for these two times indicate the changes in Aquila's authority. With these as fundamental references, we can forecast the positions of the other Heavenly Palaces.\\n\\nFor example, when the Dawn Device is at its brightest, the Dawn Palace's position is directly above.\\nAt this moment: The Earth Palace is positioned east, Tide Palace is west, Evernight Palace is located directly below, and the other Heavenly Palaces are positioned in clockwise order.\\n\\n<i>*No idea who wrote a note at the side: *</i>\\n<i>The Dawn Device's light changes... I can't see anything. Also, this is considered astrology?</i>\\n<i>You can't take this book's contents too seriously. Don't be misled by those devious disciples of Oronyx!!!</i>\\n\\n<align=\"center\"><size=28>Chapter 3: Chart Mapping</size></align>\\nAfter ascertaining the Heavenly Palaces' positions, the next step is to draw the chart. The chart is a circular diagram divided into twelve equal sections, each section representing a Heavenly Palace.\\n\\nMapping steps are as follows:\\n1. Draw a big circle representing the entire world.\\n2. Divide this circle into twelve equal sections.\\n3. Within each section, mark the corresponding Palace names and the Titans governing them.\\n4. Determine, according to the Dawn Device's changes in light, the exact positions of the Heavenly Palaces.\\n5. Draw a smaller circle at the center of the big circle, representing the divined individual.\\n\\nRemember, the chart is not fixed, nor unchanging. With the passage of time, the positions of each Heavenly Palace will also change. This is why the precise recording of time is essential.\\n\\n<align=\"center\"><size=28>Chapter 4: Interpreting the Titans' Influence</size></align>\\nOnce the mapping of the chart is complete, you can start to interpret the Titans' influence on us. Influence is largely dependent on two factors: the Heavenly Palaces' positions and the aspect relations between Heavenly Palaces.\\n\\n[Positional Influence]\\nThe influence of the Heavenly Palace in the east is strongest, symbolizing new life and ascendance.\\nThe Heavenly Palace directly above represents the state of apex.\\nThe influence of the Heavenly Palace in the west is weaker, representing decline.\\nThe influence of the Heavenly Palace directly below is weakest, yet also hints at the possibility of concealment and rebirth.\\n\\n[Aspect Relations]\\nOpposition: Two Heavenly Palaces are <unbreak>180</unbreak> degrees apart, representing conflict and opposition.\\nTrine: <unbreak>120</unbreak> degrees apart, representing harmony and complementarity.\\nSquare: <unbreak>90</unbreak> degrees, representing anxiety and challenge.\\nSextile: <unbreak>60</unbreak> degrees apart, representing opportunity and potential.\\n\\nFor example, if the Erudite Palace and War Palace form an opposition, it can be construed as a clash between reason and violence. And if the Erudite Palace and Omniscience Palace form a trine, it may mean that the powers of erudition and omniscience are harmonized \u2014 a grand opportunity to perform study and discovery.\\n\\n<align=\"center\"><size=28>Chapter 5: Practice and Caution</size></align>\\nAs a beginner, you can start off with simple everyday divinations. For example, performing a reading at the Entry Hour to forecast the general direction of the day. During the Curtain-Fall Hour, review your astrological notes for the day to see if your results match the readings of the day's start.

This hereby records its grandest Twelve Trials, which I hope will allow you to <s>understand my great love for dromases</s> evangelizing the repute of the dromas, Herakles.\\n\\nBattling the Verax Leo:\\nThe fabled Verax Leo that does not slip on its words was thwarted by Herakles! Against the Verax Leo's acerbic inquiries, Herakles successfully silenced it with sheer strength, and after paying the compensation fee, adorned its saddle with the lion's mask.\\n\\nTiny chimera rescue:\\nHydra was a wounded little chimera, losing eight of its nine tails from black tide corruption. 'Twas fortunate Herakles lent a hand! It lunged toward this little chimera and carried it on its back, successfully breaking through the black tide's encirclement.\\n\\nLiberating Aquila's hunter:\\nHunter Selene, self-proclaimed recipient of Aquila's blessing, had been pursuing a deer of prophecy for many years. The eagle-eyed Herakles sighted a pair of antlers among the black tide's vestiges, and successfully persuaded this hunter to abandon a mission that could never be accomplished.\\n\\nHelping Oleinus' farmers:\\nOleinus' farmers suffered from a wild boar invasion. They rampaged throughout the countryside, fleeting and erratically violent. The erudite Herakles procured ample fruits to lure them away, and defeated them in one fell swoop outside the village.\\n\\nCleaning the Ikaria dromases' home:\\nIkaria's dromas stable lacked upkeep, and was infamous for its filthy state. The local dromases tolerated the threat of sickness to varying degrees, but never fear! The brave Herakles dislodged the riverbanks on both flanks of the dromases' abode \u2014 water from the two artificial inlets gushed the place clean, and the dromases could once again enjoy a life of cleanliness.\\n\\nDriving away the Stymphalian avians:\\nThere lived oddly-visaged birds with metal plumes on Stymphalia, frequently stealing olive oil and attacking oil mills and oild presses. The dromas Herakles invited the locals to stand on its back and pelt them with slingshots. After three days of non-stop stone showers, the birds were finally driven away.\\n\\nFinding Handak's prized bull:\\nHandak's pedigree bulls were the pride of the local town, but a certain purebred bull had \"eloped\" with an ordinary spotted cow... 'Twas fortuitous that Herakles unleashed his unmatched might and forcefully dragged the obstinate animal back to the cattle pen in Handak City. Appreciative of Herakles' deed, the locals even let it revel in unlimited quantities of Handak's red earth!\\n\\nTaming Odressian's frenzied dromases:\\nDue to the negligence of Odressian's dromas caretaker, red earth tainted by the black tide was fed to them, causing the four dromases there to go berserk. Fortunately, the mighty Herakles was with us \u2014 it single-handedly held down this quartet of enraged dromases till all traces of the black tide were fully digested in their systems, returning their mental states to their usual docility.\\n\\nWinning the saddle blessed by Kephale:\\nBesides braving the dangers of the world, Herakles is also a champion dromas renowned by all in Okhema! When the city organized its inaugural Dromas Games, as the top seed that registered first, Herakles clinched top spots in all participating events, convincingly triumphing over the other five contenders, and winning a sacred saddle blessed by Kephale (Sponsor: Mr. Iason).\\n\\nBringing back Kadir's lost dromases:\\nA trio of Kadir City's dromases were stolen away by a fraudster in the dead of night. Using its acute olfactory senses, Herakles adroitly pinpointed the direction in which the culprit fled, recovering the lost dromases in a mountain ravine, and aided the guards in apprehending the fraudster.\\n\\nAttaining the Grove of Epiphany's reward apple:\\nOkhema's second Dromas Games was sponsored and organized by an anonymous enthusiast of the sport, with its prize being a redsoil apple specially produced by the Grove of Epiphany. Inevitably, Herakles did not disappoint its supporters, emerging champion, and happily wolfed down this priceless synthetic apple.\\n\\nAssisting in extracting black tide creation samples:\\nThis was Herakles' most incredible trial till now! It was all thanks to its long neck that the people managed to retrieve a precious sample from the edge of the all-annihilating black tide, accomplishing a mission that even the Grove of Epiphany deemed nigh impossible. The sole lament was Herakles' nonchalance throughout the ordeal that everyone failed to grasp the peril of this quest...\\n\\nThe above is the Grand Trial of Twelve that Herakles the dromas performed! I trust that in the near future, this list will only be extended to thirteen, fourteen... till it reaches twenty-four feats!\\n",

    "-1828464988": "The Chrysalis of Gold bestowed upon humanity the heart to pursue love, allowing us to passionately listen to those romantic tribulations of the Titans. Among the Titans, Nikador, scorned as the savage god, is highly favored among poets and dramatists. This piece focuses on the brief analysis of the many love stories circulating among folklore \u2014 it dissects the complex emotions that humans have on this Titan and Castrum Kremnos.\\n\\n<i>Nikador and Bepsis</i>\\nIt is said that Bepsis was born in Mnestia's temple, and personally blessed by the Chrysalis of Gold, giving her golden hair and eyes. Even her nursemaid, who carried her, almost swooned at her sheer beauty. Bepsis's beauty only became even more outstanding as she matured. To stem her endless stream of suitors, Bepsis' tyrannical father declared that only those who dueled his three sons and emerged victorious would win her hand. Her three armor-clad brothers were unmatched in the arena \u2014 those who came forth to court her were either beaten to a pulp or fled before they even unsheathed their blades.\\n\\nBepsis's beauty also attracted Nikador's attention. They transformed into a young man and boldly issued a challenge to her brothers. The trio, unwitting to the truth, were defeated thoroughly, and had no choice but to betroth her to Nikador. The man arranged for Bepsis to meet at the edge of the highest peak outside the city on the night of the third day, where he would take away his lover. When that night came, Bepsis came to the appointed spot, but only saw a towering giant. Thinking her lover had been slain and fearing her purity ruined by this giant, she leaped off the cliff in a fit of sorrow, thus ending this love that had not even begun.\\n\\nNote: Unlike the myths, Bepsis' father and three brothers met their deaths in battle against Castrum Kremnos in real life. Bepsis, refusing to be humiliated after the city was besieged, chose to take her own life in the end. Nikador triumphing over her brothers, revealing their terrifying visage, and forcing the maiden to end her own life are indubitably metaphors in this tale.\\n\\n...\\n\\n<i>Courting Talanton</i>\\nWhile the origin of this story is impossible to verify, it gained popularity from a play called <i>The Weight of Soil</i> in the holy city of Okhema during the Chrysos War. The Scale of Justice, Talanton, was revered by Nikador for their power, and Georios was smitten by them for their fairness. Talanton bade the two suitors seek out the treasure that best represented their love, and in return, would reciprocate the worth in kind.\\n\\nThe foolish Nikador sought advice from their bosom friend, asking what was equivalent to the love of the Law Titan? Thanatos of the River of Souls told them that only death, which takes away all things fairly, would be truly fair.\\n\\nThe composed Georios sought advice from Mnestia and Cerces in the forest: How should they respond to Talanton's riddle? Mnestia instigated Georios to give up their own Coreflame, though that would mean the earth would never blossom with vibrant life ever again. Cerces persuaded them to follow their heart, to seek out their most precious treasure.\\n\\nAnd so, Nikador hurled their lance, presenting an obliterated city to Talanton as a gift. Talanton placed their own Coreflame on one side of the scale \u2014 if the corpses in the city could balance it out, Nikador would have won their love. Alas, the scale did not budge.\\n\\nGeorios placed a handful of wheat offered by the humans on the scale. This seemingly shoddy gift pressed the scale down, becoming even heavier than the Coreflame on the Scale of Justice, for it bore with it history and humanity's lives, existence, and future. Finally, because Talanton could not offer more love than this, they were forced to decline Georios' pursuit. However, later poets would often jest that the Scale of Justice prohibited the love in one's heart from moving Amphoreus's balance, and that this was just an excuse.\\n\\nNote: In this story, the portrayal of the foolish, brutal Nikador clearly vilifies the Titans. The educational and political undertones contained within also indirectly portray war's influence on Okhema's theatrical creativity. Rather than saying people enjoyed making up Nikador's romantic history, one could as well say that they reveled in seeing the failures of the Titan in love. In a certain sense, this reflects the discrimination and animosity the various cities held for Castrum Kremnos during the Golden War.",

I built an actual vault based on this sole learning.\\n\\n...Perhaps this is enough? I may not be knowledgeable, and am unable to pen epic sagas, but at least I can leave behind a formula. If a city can't even leave behind a formula for its descendants, then it is truly gone.\\n\\nAh, my older brother is telling me to hurry up. The holy city squad is setting off very soon. When we arrive, we will learn Okhema's culture, integrate ourselves into their lives, and become one of them. The time of Sabanians will end here.\\n\\nI will finish my writing here.\\n\\nMaybe one day in the future, when the black tide ebbs, I hope people will return to their hometowns, the children of their children will learn everything about us, and they will shed tears where I left this carved slate... even if I won't be able to witness it.\\n\\nI hope, when that time comes, we can still build vaults.",

    "93849313": "<align=\"center\">Light Calendar Year 4\u2588\u2588\u2588, Month of Gate</align>\\n\\n<i>I have decided to record the recent unusual behavior of the dromases. Perhaps one day, these logs will help me understand what happened to them. I am deeply vexed as a vet \u2014 never have I seen such symptoms. Even the medical journals Grandfather left me did not record such an occurrence.</i>\\n\\n<align=\"center\">\"Behavioral Observations\"</align>\\n1. Strange cries during the Hour of Curtain Fall:\\n-The tone is higher than usual, closer to the sound an ancient horn makes, like sobbing\\n-Durations are inconsistent, lasting from a few moments to the entire Hour of Curtain Fall\\n-They will respond to one another in most cases, forming some sort of rhythm\\n-During their wails, their eyes will instinctively gaze in the direction of the horizon\\n\\n2. Anomalous Movement:\\n-Caravans report many instances of dromases abruptly stopping\\n-They will stamp at the ground in place, digging at the ground with their forepaws, as if looking for something\\n-Sometimes they will refuse to move, until the Hour of Curtain Fall passes\\n<i>What is worth paying attention to is that this behavior occurs mostly in locations far away from Okhema</i>\\n\\n<align=\"center\">\"Physical Status\"</align>\\n1. Compared to previous measurements\\n-Body temperature slightly increased (+<unbreak>0.3</unbreak>~<unbreak>0.5</unbreak> degrees)\\n-Faster heartbeat rate (Increased 7~<unbreak>10</unbreak> times per minute)\\n-Appetite is normal, but with changed preferences to certain ores, exhibiting an unusually high desire for ores deep in the earth\\n\\n2. Environmental Reactions:\\n-Refusal to get close to the sand baths that they usually so love\\n-More sensitive to earthen tremors\\n-Display depressive behavior when nearing mountains or precipices\\n-But what is strange is, they surprisingly more frequently touch the ground with their horns and forepaws, like they can hear something\\n<i>The most evident change is in their attitude towards certain venues...</i>\\n<i>I have noticed their eyes have become more glazed and skittish. This reminds me of an ancient fable Grandfather used to tell me: During the Era Creatura, when Georios roused from slumber for the first time, the dromases would exhibit similar symptoms. But that's an ancient tale. It couldn't be a coincidence, could it?</i>\\n\\n<align=\"center\">\"Social Behavior\"</align>\\nThere is some comfort though:\\n-Their affection for humans hasn't waned\\n-They still allow caretakers to touch and groom their fur\\n-They cozy up to humans even more than usual, regularly seeking out human warmth\\n-Especially during the Hour of Curtain Fall, they will gather in the vicinity of their caretakers\\n\\nTreatment Attempts:\\n-Increase daily massage frequency to help them relax\\n-Increase dosage of calming herbs in their drinking water\\n-Change their sandbath method, directly splashing their bodies with sand\\n-Try using music to soothe their nerves\\n<i>Current applied measures have not seen visible effects. This leads to my increasing suspicion as to whether their erratic behavior is even caused by an illness.</i>\\n\\n<align=\"center\">\"Deductions\"</align>\\nI have begun to contemplate an audacious deduction: Could some innate instinct be awakening within them? Dromases are blessed gifts bequeathed unto us by Georios after all \u2014 their connection to this land is unfathomable.\\nA few days ago, I perused some ancient texts pertaining to the origin of dromases. According to these records, they were spawned from Georios' spine. If this is true, then their perception of this great land could far surpass our imagination.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">\"Follow-up\"</align>\\n-Continue detailed records of their behavioral change\\n-Seek the opinions of some scholars researching the Titan history\\n-Attempt to ascertain the time patterns of their abnormal behavior\\n-Collect related reports from more caravans\\n\\n<i>Addendum: Earlier today, I saw the oldest dromas standing alone in a corner, emitting low wails. Its eyes reminded me of how the earth shook one time before the black tide arrived. I have begun to seriously consider maybe we shouldn't treat their abnormal behavior as some kind of sickness, but try to understand with an open mind the message they are trying to tell us.</i>",

    "2063217782": "<i>Amphoreus' calendar was personally measured and defined by Kephale \u2014 people consider it an enduring constancy within increasingly volatile chaos. But perhaps at some moment in the future, even this unchanging constant can't escape the winds of change.</i>\\n\\n<size=28>The Week and the Days Within</size>\\nExcluding the Month of Fortune, the number of days in each Amphorean month is highly standardized: Every month has four weeks, and every week has seven days, with Sunday being a rest day. Such a custom has been passed down since before the sun faded, and there is a legend of its origin...\\n\\nDuring the Era Creatura, Aquila and Oronyx exerted authority over day and night respectively. However, the night skies of those days were only scattered with clustered stars, hardly a match for the massive celestial body such as the sun. Driven by a competitive streak, Oronyx utilized gems to absorb Aquila's radiance, intertwining it with the satin of the night and shaped a satellite planet that would illuminate the night sky \u2014 what everyone knows now as the moon. This undertaking only cost a day's effort.\\n\\nOronyx scrutinized this article, proud of their own creation of perfection. But one meager moon could not rival the brightness the sun offered. And so Oronyx continued to toil away for six sleepless days and nights. For each night that approached, an extra moon would light up the sky. On the sixth day, six shadows accompanied the footsteps of all creatures.\\n\\nThe presence of the six moons sowed chaos with the tides, incurring Phagousa's scorn. And thus, on the seventh day, with sweet ambrosia incomprehensible to mortals, Phagousa drowned Oronyx in a drunken stupor, causing the latter to sleep the day away. When the night veil fell, the number of moons finally ceased to grow. Phagousa's actions were but a prank on Oronyx, but inadvertently prevented yet another possible war between Aquila and Oronyx.\\n\\nHowever, the existence of six moons did not adhere to balance. Talanton, who had come after catching wind of this, stirred the scale and eliminated two-thirds of the moons, leaving only the red and gold moon, representing the Scarlet Month and Golden Month respectively. When the sun rose on the eighth day, an awoken Oronyx was forbidden from creating any more moons. And that was how the week's cycle was determined. When amending the celestial laws, Kephale designated the seventh day that Oronyx slept through as a rest day.\\n\\n<size=28>Periods of a Day</size>\\nWhen finalizing the calendar, Kephale divided one day into five major periods, to teach its people to punctually rise, work, rest, and slumber.\\n\\nEver since the scorching sun departed from the sky, the task of illuminating Okhema fell to the Dawn Device \u2014 shifts in its light were not obvious to the people in the beginning, and they could only maintain their routines by adhering to the five major periods from before.\\n\\n<b>Entry Hour</b>\\nThe time period when various activities gradually begin. People start to rouse from their slumber, summoning their consciousness back to their bodies from distant realms, as if traversing a formless doorway. They fetch water, wash up, and head to the morning market. Those who need something will commit to prayer.\\n\\n<b>Lucid Hour/Ascent Hour</b>\\nThe period of the day when one is most awake, thoughts shining into their minds like light piercing glass. People engage in conversation, share teachings, insights and anecdotes, akin to golden threads interwoven with one another. Scholars perform their tasks at twice the speed during this period.\\n\\n<b>Action Hour/Descent Hour</b>\\nThe period when enlightenment of the mind starts to wither. People put down their books, exiting outdoors for exercise and labor, take care of plants and animals, their perspiration dripping down, seeping into the soil. Scholars and idlers file into the bath in an attempt to invigorate the mind's eye with Phagousa's waters, but the session inevitably ends up in drunken revelry.\\n\\n<b>Parting Hour</b>\\nThe period when production activities start to come to rest. People end their day's work at this time, bidding their friends and companions farewell. The army or travelers will usually choose this period to embark on an expedition to minimize disruptions to residential lives.\\n\\n<b>Curtain-Fall Hour</b>\\nPeople draw their curtains, a period of pillowed rest. A thief star belonging to Zagreus will sail across the auburn sky when this moment ends, punctuating its descent with a long trail, signaling to people that a day has passed. This is also the period when thieves are most active.\\n\\n<b>About Thief Star</b>: A characteristically distinctive, but ultimately aimless meteor, its trajectory varying in each appearance. People often see it in the east one moment, then in the west the next. Although the stars of present have dimmed because of the Dawn Device, the thief star remains visible.\\nIn extremely rare circumstances, the thief star will emanate crimson, heralding the advent of a red moon \u2014 this is interpreted as an ominous sign, when plans will go awry, and crushing defeats suffered in battles.\\n\\n<size=28>Quints within Periods</size>\\nPeople have further divided the five major periods into five sections called \"quints.\" When sections of time need to be explicitly indicated, people will often express said time with a combination of the period and instant, such as \"Curtain-Fall Hour's third quint,\" \"Entry Hour's first quint,\" etc.\\n\\nUnits of time smaller than quints are rarely used, since people do not need such precise moments of measure.

    "-1425180460": "<i>\"Merchants may obsess over profit, but rules are required regardless to maintain balance.\" \u2014 Unknown Priest of Talanton</i>\\n\\nBalance Coins, the smallest unit of trade decreed by Talanton, as well as their gift to humanity. In the present world, Balance Coins take the form of tiny gravel-like weights that can be mixed into bigger weights with any amount like clay. It is because of this fact that a single Balance Coin simply can't be carried, and trade between cities requires dromas transportation to move obscene weights of currency. But no one can deny that this linear calculation method is indeed very \"balanced.\"\\n\\nThe history of Balance Coins can be traced back to the ancient Era Chrysea's nascent period. Before that, cities bartered using objects of Titan worship, such as shells, feathers, redsoil clay blocks etc. As the cities' supplies became more abundant, along with increasing demand for inter-city trade, merchants urgently needed some common equivalent as a medium of exchange. Gold, silver, and other precious metals came into the picture \u2014 rare in production quantity, stable in value, and effective in reducing friction during trade. From that point on, trade among the various cities gradually gravitated towards precious metals. But even the face value of the lightest copper coin far exceeded the cost of one stalk of vegetable, and this brought much inconvenience to the commonfolk.\\n\\nDuring the economic development of the various cities, many precious metals streamed into the market each year. We know that the expansion of an economy's scale relies on the support of even more currency. A wealthy merchant and city lord by the name of Midas devised a devious plan exploiting this very concept: What if I possessed all the world's gold? Wouldn't my city be unrivaled? He prayed to a certain Titan (some opine that it was Georios, some thought it was Zagreus, and others thought the patron god was Phagousa, but this remains a subject of great debate to this day), attaining the ability to control mineral resources using sinister rituals, and consolidated the entirety of Amphoreus' precious metal deposits in the mountains of his domain. He then announced this circumstance, demanding the cities to bend the knee, or there would be a dearth of future precious metals.\\n\\nEven so, history always finds a way. After precious metal was monopolized, the cities did not cease their daily trade \u2014 Phagousa's city gathered shells, Georios' city gathered stones, Aquila's city bundled feathers... The people once again returned to the days of barter, and life went on as usual \u2014 it was only inter-city trade that was untenable. The irony was that these sundries were portable and plentiful, increasing people's enthusiasm in trade.\\n\\nTo quell this farce, Talanton overturned the scale, turning bountiful gravel into weights enchanted with divinity, and established it as the common currency across all cities, which are the Balance Coins of today \u2014 encompassing both the benefits and drawbacks of goods and precious metals. With the Scale of Justice being the most trustworthy, with the god's personal guarantee, inter-city trade was very quickly restored. Midas went increasingly mad when he was besieged by Castrum Kremnos, and eventually turned into a statue of pure gold.",

As their rage and ambition were never quelled, their Titankin legion still roams the land, waging war against imaginary enemies.\\n\\nNikador is a noble warrior that wears pure white sacred armor. Legend has it that the Lance of Fury that they wield can raze even the most powerful and prosperous city to the ground. Their bloodthirsty temperament has also made them a god of blood and sacrifice. Warriors gather under them and yearn to follow Nikador into war and achieve an honorable death. Their disciples built a fortress known as Castrum Kremnos that brings turmoil and fear to the world, much like their god.\\n\\nThere was once a time when this war god was also a symbol of protection: Using extreme violence to extinguish strife and using war to maintain the balance of Amphoreus.",

Legend states that when the black tide descended, their mountain peaks raised and caused huge ravines to open up. They were split into pieces and unable to ever reawaken.\\n\\nGeorios is also the god of agriculture and history. They gifted their body to the Titans to become the cornerstone of the creation of life. When death and famine raged, they ignored the wrath of Cerces and shared knowledge of agriculture with the people of the world. This knowledge stuck with the Amphoreus for millennia. People often use the \"hourglass\" to commemorate this benevolent deity. Not wishing for any kind of compensation, Georios has always been silent in the face of the praise of mortals.\\n\\nThe \"Mountain Dwellers\" and \"dromases\" of Amphoreus are all creations of Georios. The clumsy Titan never quite grasped the finer points of creation and always made their creations far too big.

Therefore, relying on the charisma of a single leader is far from enough to accurately extend the Titan's will to everyone in an army, let alone a city. A king cannot possibly monitor every development on every front at all times. Yet coordination \u2014 or, more specifically, the ability to launch attacks at the right time and in the right place \u2014 is the single most crucial factor in securing battlefield advantages for any army. This is where the importance of strategic advisory becomes evident: Advisors are the commanding officer's most indispensable aides. Through close collaboration, they provide intelligence, craft plans, organize units to implement battle arrangements, and offer valuable counsel to the commanding officer. They must ensure that the commanding officer maintains a focus on strategic and operational levels, rather than on specific tactics, such as redeploying a squadron fifty paces east, thereby enabling wise decision-making.\\n\\nWar is a systemic endeavor, one that maximizes the use of violence against each other. Some foolish cities dream of finding an ingenious method to achieve decisive victories and win the enemy's heartfelt submission without significant casualties. Such fantasies not only disgrace the Titan they revere but often result in even greater losses for their compatriots at the hands of the enemy. In my opinion, the root of this folly lies in these city leaders' disregard for advisory work, along with their irreverence toward Nikador. Anyone with practical knowledge of strategic advisory and the complexity of military conflict understands that there is no path to success without the application of force. Even diplomatic activities \u2014 often mild and friendly as they may seem \u2014 involve military calculations beyond the comprehension of the ignorant.\\n\\nIn recent years, Castrum Kremnos has witnessed the rise of a dangerous misconception: that war is a divine authority of Nikador and that it will help us obtain whatever we desire as long as we, the ordinary people, demonstrate sufficient \u2014 though often self-destructive \u2014 devotion to it. This is not what Nikador wants. On the contrary, Nikador desires that we actively engage in all the struggles of survival, using our own wits to secure our place in the world rather than having them do it for us. \"Better to die in battle than return even in glory\" \u2014 this motto does not call for us to die senseless deaths on the battlefield. What it truly indicates is that one should only fall while striving for a cause the person deems worthy, specifically in the pursuit of glory for Castrum Kremnos. It signifies giving one's all and fighting for the \"meaning of one's existence in the world.\" In light of this, I believe the greatest value of this course lies in learning to face future conflicts with composure, understanding the principles of solidarity through the study of strategic advisory, and securing the highest chances of defeating your enemies.\\n\\nIn this course, we will explore the roles and responsibilities of advisors, the necessary qualities and capabilities they must possess, the procedures and methods of strategic advisory, the relationship between advisors and commanding officers, and the various roles of advisors during peacetime training and wartime engagement. This is the eighth edition of this course's textbook since its establishment. It now includes substantial updates on practical guidance for combating the black tide. Special thanks go to Royal Wing Elite Krateros, who generously provided numerous valuable materials and insights for this revision, including this very foreword.",

According to ancient prophecies, this signals that Zagreus's schemes are unfolding. But I have a feeling that there's more to it than meets the eye.

While poring over the ancient prophecy texts, I stumbled upon a startling discovery \u2014 certain phrases had been deliberately altered. For example, the original text \"Re\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to the Era Chrysea\" has been changed to \"Returning to the Era Chrysea.\" This minute difference disquiets me, but what truly chills me to the bone is the question \u2014 who, or what group, is secretly meddling with these texts?\\n\\nWhat unsettles me even more is that as I was organizing the prophecy repository, I discovered that the records about \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 are slowly vanishing. It's not due to human intervention; rather, the ink seems to be fading away on its own, as though time itself is erasing that part of history.\\nI have a hunch that the Three Titans of Fate have already glimpsed into this unfolding. That's probably why the prophecies of Oronyx have become increasingly obscure, the scales of Talanton have lost their balance, and the gates of Janus now quiver with unease.\\n<align=\"right\">\u2014 Helena</align>\\n\\n<size=28>Fifth Missive</size>\\nDear Sisters,\\nThe gravity of our circumstances now demands decisive action. In my meditation, I had a chilling vision \u2014 the world being engulfed by a dark tide. It's not the Thanatos' River of Souls we're dealing with, but something far older and more wicked.\\n\\nI propose the following:\\n1. Secretly reinforce the seals of the Temple of the Three Fates.\\n2. Make three copies of all prophecy documents and distribute them for safekeeping.\\n3. Find and protect those \"special\" children.\\n4. Brace ourselves for the worst-case scenario.\\n\\nRemember: If the world is indeed marching towards its doom, our mission is to safeguard the Coreflame of hope. Even if the threads of destiny have been corrupted, we must do our utmost to protect the last untainted golden thread.\\n\\nMay the Three Titans of Fate bless Amphoreus.

    "497133842": "<align=\"center\">Foreword</align>\\nPomegranate juice originated from Castrum Kremnos. It was not just a beverage, but a cultural symbol as well. This paper will attempt to examine the origin and the evolution of this tradition and create a comprehensive record for the Hereafter.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">I. Historical Origin</align>\\nAncient Indiscretion\\nAccording to the Chronicles of War, located in the archives in the Council of Elders, Castrum Kremnos, during the early days of Era Bellica, followers of Nikador had the unfortunate practice of drinking their enemies' blood. At that time, Kremnoan believed that drinking the blood of powerful enemies would grant them the valiance of the deceased. There was no evidence, but it was a popular tradition.\\n\\nThe Enigma of Phagousa\\nAround Year <unbreak>2600</unbreak> of the Light Calendar, a critical event changed the tradition. A conflict broke out between Castrum Kremnos and the Seaside States, and Nikador traveled with their troops to win conquer three cities in succession. After the war, Nikador requested the defeated to offer the blood of their residents, or they would suffer from divine punishment.\\nAccording to the Story of the Tide, Phagousa, the Ocean Titan, appeared to save the poor residents. They ordered their followers to drink pomegranate juice instead, and imbued their powers in the juice. Nikador was unable to tell the difference between pomegranate and blood, and even praised the beverage for its flavor.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">II. Change</align>\\nReplacement Proposal\\nInterestingly, this sparked an intense debate in the Council of Elders. The conservative faction believed that giving up blood consumption was a sign of weakness, whereas the progressive faction claimed that Nikador's approval of pomegranate juice carried great significance.\\nUltimately, General Kraso left a statement that signified the change: \"We all know the wisdom of Nikador and Phagousa. Pomegranates have the same color as blood and taste like blood, so isn't its juice fitting for a warrior? Consuming large quantities of pomegranate juice before a battle would demonstrate our valiance and carry on Nikador's legacy. Is this not a perfect solution?\"\\n\\nEstablished Law\\nIn Year <unbreak>2650</unbreak> of the Light Calendar, the Council of Elders formally declared that pomegranate juice would replace blood, and created relevant rituals and rules. This signified a critical change in the beverage culture of Council of Elders.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">III. Recipe Evolution</align>\\nTraditional Recipe\\nThe recipe was extremely simple during its infancy:\\nFreshly squeezed pomegranate juice\\nA pinch of salt\\nAn iron vessel for storage (for the rusty flavor)\\n\\nMilitary Recipe\\nThe \"empowered\" version popular in the military:\\nFreshly squeezed pomegranate juice\\nMinced raw ginger\\nSea salt\\nDendrobium catenatum (this version allegedly enhanced stamina, and was often consumed before marching)\\n\\nRitual Recipe\\nTo be used during important rituals:\\nWild pomegranate (must be picked from a battlefield)\\nHoney (represents Phagousa's gift)\\nAn iron vessel for soaking\\nBlessings from a priest\\n<i>Note: In modern times, this recipe is used during important ceremonies such as the Rite of the Shield.</i>\\n\\nModern Controversy\\nDuring recent years, a group led by a famous warrior created a new recipe by adding goat's milk and cheese, giving the beverage a light pink hue. The conservatives on the Council of Elders expressed their discontent at this change. However, research showed that dairy was included in Phagousa's original recipe, so maybe the new recipe was actually closer to the beverage's original form.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">IV. Ritual Significance</align>\\nMilitary\\n1. Before an expedition: The army consumes the beverage together to show solidarity.\\n2. Upon a triumphant return: Generals drink first, and their subordinates drink together afterward.\\n3. At the funerals for the deceased: Pomegranate juice is sprinkled on shields to symbolize the return of these soldiers.\\n\\nCivilian\\n1. Coming of Age Ceremony: Youths drink pomegranate juice for the first time.\\n2. Rite of the Shield: Parents drink with their children when the latter depart.\\n3. Alliance Ceremony: The entities creating the Alliance drink from the same cup.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">V. Revelation</align>\\nThe evolution of the tradition symbolizes the advancement of the Castrum Kremnos civilization. The growth of a people can be seen in the change from barbaric blood rituals to elegant ceremonies. Phagousa imparted the wisdom that change did not necessarily mean leaving the tradition behind, and that it could be seen as a more sophisticated way of passing on the tradition.\\nWhat must be noted here, however, is that the key to pomegranate juice replacing blood lies in the fact that the core concept of the warrior culture was preserved \u2014 the valiance that transcended even death \u2014 and that is why Castrum Kremnos still stands tall today.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Conclusion</align>\\nMay the warriors who drink the pomegranate juice forever remember the history and the glory contained within. As remarked by an ancient sage, \"pomegranate juice is not blood, but it carries a deeper significance than blood.\"\\n\\n<i>Afterword: A special thanks to the archives of Castrum Kremnos and Council of Elders for supporting the research.</i>",

    "1303702897": "<i>(...)</i>\\n\\nNo matter what we do, experience is essential. However, that might not hold true when it comes to the black tide. Imagine a master potter effortlessly surpassing his apprentices \u2014 experience usually counts. But surviving the black tide once doesn't guarantee safety the next time. Confronting this seemingly sentient natural disaster \u2014 though this idea is not confirmed, the black tide always strikes at our weakest points, and that's why I'm inclined to believe in this proposition \u2014 requires more than just relying on past experience and habitual thinking. Doing so will only lead to greater losses.\\n\\nAs we have already discussed, the hazards posed by the black tide encompass two major components:\\n\\n(I) The inexplicable black tide itself\\n\\n(II) The terrifying creatures that emerge from the black tide\\n\\nWhen the black tide is relatively small in scale, we can temporarily diminish it by eliminating the monsters it spawns. However, if the monsters emerge faster than we can deploy forces to counter them, the black tide quickly expands beyond our ability to manage. This makes \"assessing the black tide's scale\" a critical challenge: If we underestimate it, a considerable number of our excellent warriors may die in vain due to overconfidence. Conversely, if we overestimate it, we will waste resources on relocating people and assets, which will inevitably disrupt normal life and cause unnecessary panic, thereby hampering the smooth functioning of the city.\\n\\n<i>(...)</i>\\n\\nAmong all the cities of Amphoreus, two cities stand out for their relatively effective methods of countering the black tide:\\n\\n(I) Castrum Kremnos\\nWe are all familiar with this situation: We utilize the great mobility of Castrum Kremnos to deploy forces proactively, aiming to subdue the black tide as soon as it appears. While this approach has proven effective due to our efficient military mobilization, the steadily increasing casualties in each battle serve as a grim reminder that even with Nikador's blessings, whether Castrum Kremnos can consistently win such wars remains an open question.\\n\\n(II) Okhema\\nTo the Kremnoans, the Okhemans seem to have done nothing at all. They simply hide behind Kephale, as if they were still living in the Era Chrysea, with no sense of crisis or honor. However, I must point out that the Okhemans' wit lies exactly in leveraging their strengths without shame. They achieved a result similar to ours in battling against the black tide, but at a much smaller cost. (Seen from their perspective, their reliance on the protection of Kephale is hardly a flaw, a point I believe most would agree with.)\\n\\nTo sum up, both Castrum Kremnos and its rival city, Okhema, have their own strengths and shortcomings in confronting the black tide. Obviously, it doesn't take a man of extraordinary wit to realize that the deep-rooted systemic flaws cannot be fixed with temporary measures in no time. Yet the black tide's threat persists, and it's growing so fast that soon even Nikador won't be able to handle it alone.\\n\\nGiven the above-mentioned analysis, we may reach the following conclusion:\\n\\nBefore the black tide grows too powerful to handle, we must unite the power of Castrum Kremnos and Okhema. The smaller cities won't make much of a difference. We have three possible ways to achieve this:\\n\\n1. Castrum Kremnos annexes Okhema, taking full control of its resources and strengths.\\n\\n2. Okhema annexes Castrum Kremnos, taking full control of its resources and strengths.\\n\\n3. Castrum Kremnos and Okhema merge into a united entity with the spirit of Kremnos.\\n\\n<i>(...)</i>",

But one stood out: Clitun. This kid lost his parents when he was young and was raised by the kindness of the villagers. It's no wonder his eyes burn with fierce determination. In my experience, kids who endure hardship from a young age often grow into something extraordinary, if they can just make it through.\\n\\nDuring the routine pep talk, I made a point of saying, \"From the moment you set foot in this military camp, you all become one thing: The swords of Nikador. Swords don't ponder; they just need to stay sharp and be ready.\"\\n\\nI hope Clitun gets the message.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Training Month, Day 3</align>\\nWe kicked off with basic physical training today.\\nThe recruits had plenty to gripe about the pomegranate juice, saying it was too astringent.

Those who can't stomach it don't deserve to wear the uniform of a Kremnoan warrior.\\nClitun truly shone today. He volunteered to carry twice the usual weight during training.

    "-665665578": "...\\n\\nThe Express suffered an attack from an unknown source, and we were forced to make an emergency stop at an unknown location. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries. Looking at the buildings in the surrounding area, we were able to make an initial inference that this world contained civilized life. While exploring a temple, we made first contact with the people of Amphoreus. They called themselves the Chrysos Heirs and were in the area to rescue refugees headed to the \"holy city\" of Okhema. The two Amphoreans were quite remarkable. The Chrysos Heir named Tribbie was able to use a mysterious power of space-time replication to repair buildings. The Chrysos Heir Phainon boasted remarkable martial arts prowess, breaking my lance with a single strike.\\n\\nWe rushed to the holy city with the refugees, but the Strife Titan \"Nikador\" happened to launch a surprise attack upon our arrival. The Titans are the Gods worshiped by the Amphoreans. It is currently unknown as to whether they have any relation to the Aeons. The Titankin of Nikador are extremely ferocious. With the situation looking dire, we offered our assistance to Phainon. We defeated every Titankin that stood in our paths, protected the citizens, and finally faced the body of Nikador alongside Phainon. Throughout this process, we came to meet Chrysos Heirs known as Mydei and Castorice. Mydei's martial arts skill was similar to that of Phainon, and Castorice was able to steal the life energy of others through touch.\\n\\nIt seemed that the Nikador that took part in this attack was just one of the many manifestations of the Strife Titan. Phainon was unable to obtain the crucial Coreflame that they spoke of. The leader of the Chrysos Heirs, Aglaea, took us to Marmoreal Palace and had the bath sprites tell us the history of Amphoreus. We learned that the Twelve Titans created Amphoreus, but that this world was now under threat of extermination. The Titans have lost their minds, and the Chrysos Heirs must defeat them one-by-one to light the Coreflames and save Amphoreus.\\n\\nAglaea also wields a remarkable ability... Her golden thread had the ability to read people's minds. She made a strange request of us: To not expose our identity as visitors from beyond the sky to the people of Okhema. The \"holy city\" of Okhema is the only place of eternal daytime in this world of apocalyptic night. We explored the city and came to learn of the local customs, as well as collecting reliable information. However, March 7th's picture was unexpectedly leaked. Not only did this lead to her being heralded as the \"Rosy Celestial Maiden\" by the Okheman citizenry, it almost led to a fatal mistake. However, we were able to rescue this citizen that was hell-bent on exploring the skies at the cost of exposing our identities as guests from beyond the sky. Unfortunately, this meant betraying our promise to Aglaea.\\n\\n...\\n\\nIn the end, our luck ran out. The golden thread of Aglaea spreads across all of Okhema and news of these decisions eventually reached her ears. The leader of the Chrysos Heirs finally exposed her ruthless and unfeeling side, threatening our lives and asking us again why it was that we had come to Amphoreus. Though we passed her examination, our impression of Amphoreus had dropped considerably, and we even considered leaving for a new destination. However, as we followed Phainon and learned of the Chrysos Heirs' brutal journey ahead to save their world, we finally decided to remain in Amphoreus.\\n\\nAfter some recovery, the Chrysos Heirs reconvened once more. They prepared to begin a crusade against Castrum Kremnos, the city in which Nikador was located, and steal the Coreflame of the \"Lance of Fury.\" {NICKNAME}, Phainon, and Mydei all came to Castrum Kremnos. The once war-obsessed city that used to be filled with the sounds of blade and battle had now become a gloomy wasteland. Now, the insane Nikador loomed somewhere in the depths of this moving fortress.\\n\\nWhile exploring Castrum Kremnos, {NICKNAME} and the others learned that Nikador had long since hatched a plan for a terrible attack on Okhema. They successfully fought their way to Nikador. However, they unexpectedly discovered that the Titan that was once known for their glory had, at some point, forged themself an immortal body and was trying to wield the \"Blade of Fury\" to pierce Okhema from afar. In this moment of crisis, Mydei managed to restrain Nikador alone as the others returned to Okhema to discuss a way to foil Nikador's plans.\\n\\nCastorice discovered that Nikador's immortal body came from their betrayal of \"death.\" In order to break this riddle that had been long buried in time, we headed to the Temple of the Three Fates located in the Abyss and attempted to use the power of Oronyx to replicate the past. However, Oronyx did not seem to welcome us. In fact, they attempted to stop us from reaching the temple depths using various puzzles and challenges. Their final puzzle was: To find something heavier than the \"World's Destiny.\" We were able to pass this test with the help of March 7th's camera and a little trickery.\\n\\nHowever, although we made it to Oronyx's location, the Time Titan still refused to provide their assistance. Considering that time was running out to rescue Mydei, Phainon considered just killing the Titan and taking the Coreflame by force. Just as tensions were reaching a peak, Oronyx's attitude seemed to change when they laid eyes on {NICKNAME}. According to {NICKNAME}, Oronyx showed {F#her}{M#him} a memory of the Stellaron Hunters... It was a memory that logically should not exist, yet it was extremely vivid. Inside this nonexistent memory, {NICKNAME} happened to catch the gaze of the Aeon of Remembrance, Fuli. Perhaps it was a gift from Oronyx, but at this moment a mysterious creature named Mem appeared at {F#her}{M#his} side. Though {F#she}{M#he} suddenly seemed to grow... somber, {F#she}{M#he} fortunately snapped out of it quickly.\\n\\nHaving returned from the Abyss, we split up once again. Phainon and I went on to assist Mydei in their long-fought battle to the death. {NICKNAME}, on the other hand, used the power gifted to them by Oronyx to collect memory fragments and find a way to visit the Castrum Kremnos of the past. With Castorice by their side, they would find a way to undo Nikador's immortality. At the same time, Aglaea was getting to work in Okhema dealing with Nikador's infiltration.\\n\\nHaving collected the memory fragments and successfully opened the gate to Castrum Kremnos' past, {NICKNAME} arrived in the ancient city. When they arrived, they discovered that the Kremnos Festival was in full swing and Nikador's descent into madness was just beginning. The city was yet still lively, bustling. In order to ensure the success of their plan, Castorice and {NICKNAME} decided to blend in with the festival and ended up forming a three-man team with a taciturn gladiator named Gnaeus before heading deep into the city. Collecting intel as they advanced, they vowed to restore Nikador's fractured mind, stop the birth of their immortal body and restore the honor of the Strife Titan. What no one expected was that Gnaeus was actually a part of Nikador. Having learned of the suffering that awaits in the future, he fearlessly allowed himself to be integrated into Nikador's corrupted soul and made them whole again. Though we were able to undo their immortality, this also meant that the Titan stood before us in their ultimate form.\\n\\nAfter a grueling battle, the \"Lance of Fury\" Nikador came to an end at the hands of a Chrysos Heir victory. After returning to Okhema and taking some time to recover, we witnessed the return of the Coreflame of Nikador. Phainon bid us a brief farewell before entering the Vortex of Genesis to undergo the trial of the Strife Titan's Coreflame. Through this trial, Phainon would obtain the powers of a demigod, while taking on the role of the corresponding Titan. I wish him success in this endeavor.\\n\\n...",
    "2063217784": "<b><i>Preface</i></b>\\n\\nA chronicle is a measure and record of time, while a national fortune book records the rise and fall of a nation. I, Ptolemy, have studied most of the books in the archives of Castrum Kremnos. In the royal biographies, most are focused on praising the current rulers, filled with eulogistic words, yet short of insightful advice. To fill this gap, I've endeavored to trace the <unbreak>2,500</unbreak>-year history of Castrum Kremnos, documenting the dynasty's rise and decline, and the great deeds of its rulers, to preserve its enduring spirit and the legacy of Nikador for future generations to come.\\n\\n...\\n\\nMy work, <i>Kings of Kremnos</i>, is yet to complete. As I follow the lone detachment, with each day uncertain and the future's fate unknown, I may never have the chance to see the new king of Kremnos ascend to the throne. Should I fall before then, I leave it to future hands to complete this work.\\n\\n...\\n\\n<b><i>Volume One</i></b>\\nAt the dawn of the Era Bellica, Nikador forged hundreds of warriors and weapons, determined to claim the heads of the Foundation Titans. While the people of Amphoreus trembled in fear, one warlike tribe was awestruck by the Lance of Fury's glory. United under its light, they rallied to follow Nikador's path. The tribe leader was Gorgo, a warrior of unparalleled valor. Armed with a single shield and spear, they charged fearlessly into hundreds of foes. When they returned triumphant, the enemy commander's head at their belt, their breastplate shone unscathed.\\n\\nThe battle between the Strife Titan Nikador and the Sky Titan Aquila was long and arduous. In pursuit of the hundred-eyed giant bird above the clouds, Nikador's divine body often streaked from one city to another. Therefore, Gorgo's tribe had to march day and night, guided only by the earth-shaking battle roars of Nikador. During these relentless journeys, Gorgo and their followers traversed many lands and had countless wondrous encounters. After extensive research, I've chosen to record some of the most credible tales.\\n\\n...\\n\\nGorgo's most renowned feat is their barehanded battle against the great lion of Tretos. At the time, their tribe was passing through the city of Tretos, where the local lord hosted a banquet in their honor. However, no meat was served. The lord explained that a fierce lion had long occupied the outskirts of the city. All meat was regularly sent to appease the beast's hunger, for if its hunger went unsated, it would raid the city, devouring its vulnerable inhabitants.\\n\\nGorgo's tribe revered the warrior spirit of Nikador and despised the idea of settling in one place for a life of peace. Initially, they intended to leave this land to its own fate. However, after days of travel without a single taste of meat, their hunger became unbearable. Driven by desperation, they ventured to the outskirts of Tretos to hunt the lion.\\n\\nUnder the scorching sun, Gorgo and their followers, armed with spears and shields, ventured into the plain to confront the fearsome beast. Unlike ordinary lions with dull coats, this Tretos lion was extraordinary \u2014 its form as massive as a city gate, its fur gleaming like a golden flame, shining under the sunlight like a colossus gilded in gold. At the sight of this magnificent creature, Gorgo's grit ignited. Casting aside their spear and shield, they instructed their followers to stand down. They would face the beast alone, barehanded, for an ultimate battle of strength.\\n\\nThe duel was over in moments. As the lion emerged from its lair, Gorgo struck swiftly, effortlessly bringing the beast down. With a few swift blows, they shattered several of its joints. Though the lion lay defeated, its thunderous roar still echoed, enough to shatter the innards of ordinary folks. Yet Gorgo and their followers, hardened by years of following Nikador and enduring the terrifying battle cries of Titans, felt no fear. It is said that for over a century after the lion's death, its dying roar continued to reverberate across the outskirts of Tretos.\\n\\n...\\n\\nYears of pursuing Nikador had left the entire tribe utterly exhausted. It was then that they arrived at a city devoted to Oronyx, where the local priests delivered a divine oracle: The Blade of Fury and its pursuers shall forever hang above the earth. After days of deliberation, Gorgo and their followers made a decision. They would build a fortress for Nikador's arrival. When Nikador passed by, their mightiest warrior would stand atop the fortress to halt them. Then the entire tribe would display their indomitable spirit, seeking the Strife Titan's recognition and benediction.\\n\\nMonths later, the fortress was complete, and Nikador, in pursuit of Aquila, drew near Gorgo's tribe. The entire tribe shouted Nikador's name towards the divine body, but the Strife Titan, fixated on hurling spears at Aquila, paid them no heed. Seeing that Nikador was about to leave, Gorgo had an idea. They rushed into the storeroom and retrieved the head of the Tretos lion \u2014 a monstrous trophy so fearsome that perhaps even Thanatos refused to claim it. Remarkably, years had passed, yet the head remained unrotten.\\n\\nWith a few strides, Gorgo leapt onto the fortress wall, raising the lion's head high above their forehead. Using the beast's hollow skull as a resonator, they let out a deafening roar. Though not so powerful as Nikador's battle cry, it was enough to halt the Strife Titan. As Nikador turned to look back, Gorgo flung their arm and hurled the Chryseus Leo's head with such force that it embedded itself in the wall. Leading their warriors, they once again shouted praises to the Lance of Fury. The proud Strife Titan finally acknowledged their resolve and bestowed upon the tribe a blade forged by the Titan's own hand. To honor the Titan's gift, the tribe began to build a fortress around it with giant stones. Over time, a mobile citadel, known as Castrum Kremnos, took shape. Gorgo was crowned its first king, revered by later generations as the Founder of Kremnos and the Lion-Slayer King.\\n\\n...",

    "-665665572": "<align=\"right\">Recorded by: Chief Engineer Daidalos</align>\\n<align=\"right\">Date: Year <unbreak>3875</unbreak> of the Light Calendar</align>\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Site Selection Survey</align>\\nAs guided by the Lance of Fury prophecy, our ancestors constructed an arena in a dormant volcano, which has the following advantages: the magma provides sustainable energy, the mountain itself is sturdy enough to support the huge building, and, most importantly, the location is only three miles away from the Lance site, and that means the arena is protected by its divine powers.\\nAccording to the old records, initial survey revealed three potential problems:\\n1. A fissure in the rocks in the northwestern corner that must be reinforced\\n2. The underground river might impact the foundation\\n3. The volcano is dormant, but the magma is still flowing\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Overall Plan</align>\\nThe arena is divided into four areas. From bottom to top, they are:\\n1. Quarry Zone (<unbreak>-300</unbreak> to <unbreak>-200</unbreak> feet)\\n2. Sculpting Zone (<unbreak>-200</unbreak> to <unbreak>-100</unbreak> feet)\\n3. Soul-Forging Zone (<unbreak>-100</unbreak> to 0 feet)\\n4. Contest Zone (0 to <unbreak>200</unbreak> feet above ground)\\n\\nThe areas are connected by a spiraling elevator with a mechanical core powered by magma. We learned this technique from the Sons of Daedalus, but two accidents took place due to our incomplete mastery.\\nThe first accident happened in Year <unbreak>3847</unbreak> of the Light Calendar, when a gear in the elevator warped under the high heat and stopped the system. There were no casualties, but it was a lesson well-learned. Going forward, mountain copper was used to forge core components. It is a rare metal, but it remains stable under high temperatures.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Quarry Zone</align>\\nThis zone was constructed a long time ago, and must be renovated. The biggest challenge is to create enough space without affecting the structural integrity of the mountain. We employed our usual drilling procedures, but encountered an accident at <unbreak>-270</unbreak> feet. The vibrations caused the underground river to change its path, and the invading vapor triggered an explosion when it reached the magma, killing three craftsmen. May Nikador bless their souls.\\nAfter the accident, we used a detection pole to ascertain the waterways before drilling, and placed irrigation at key positions. The pipes were made from heat-resistant ceramic from the Ceramic Craftsmen's Guild in Castrum Kremnos.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Sculpting Zone</align>\\nThe Sculpting Zone is an area that showcases the highest level of craftsmanship of Kremnos masters. We designed an automated sculpting system powered by the heat from the magma. Hot steam that powers the mechanical arms is delivered to each workbench through copper pipes, and these arms do the sculpting based on pre-set tracks, boosting efficiency tremendously.\\nHowever, during an accident in Year <unbreak>3845</unbreak> of the Light Calendar, the pipes burst, and the steam jet destroyed three statues and critically injured two craftsmen. Subsequent investigation showed that the pipes were fatigued under the constant heat. We switched to using an alloy of mountain copper and ordinary copper for pipes, and increased their durability.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Soul-Forging Zone</align>\\nThis zone must be expanded to accommodate the increasing ceremony demands. The expansion perfectly combined construction techniques with ceremony demands, with heat-conducting obsidian socketed on the floor of the ring-shaped hall and a complicated network of heat pipes under them. During ceremonies, the heat of the magma travels through the network of pipes to heat up the hall and help with injecting divinity into the statue.\\nThe special dome design should also be mentioned here: several hundred holes were drilled at the top, forming the spear of Nikador. When the sun shines through them, an image of the spear falls on the center of the altar.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Contest Zone</align>\\nThe most important mechanism in this zone is the rise and fall of the greatsword in the center. This sword is both a support beam of the building and a divine weapon that decides life and death. A complicated mechanism connects the greatsword to the magma, which powers the sword. When the blade rises, the floor of the arena changes with it.\\nHowever, during a ceremony in Year <unbreak>3829</unbreak> of the Light Calendar, the system broke down and the greatsword was stuck in midair. The fight was already over, so there were no casualties. A detailed check showed that the impurities in the magma had blocked the transmission. Subsequently, a filter was added to the system with a rigorous maintenance procedure.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Maintenance Suggestions</align>\\n1. Add a backup irrigation system in the Quarry Zone.\\n2. The steam pipes in the Sculpting Zone should be checked monthly.\\n3. The heat-conducting layer on the bottom of the altar in the Soul-Forging Zone should be changed periodically.\\n4. The materials used to repair the cracks in the Contest Zone should be improved accordingly.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Afterword</align>\\nAfter many setbacks, the arena was completed during Year <unbreak>2523</unbreak> of the Light Calendar, which was more than a thousand years from now. Future Kremnos engineers should keep up with annual maintenance to repay Nikador's favor. This log is both a record and a warning, and may newcomers be inspired to improve arena maintenance and keep Nikador's glory aflame.\\n\\n<i>\"May the flames of war burn forever, may the steel howl endlessly, and may the hot blood never be extinguished.\"</i>",

Even so, after much thought, I've decided to put these words on paper.\\n\\nAs of today, I've been trapped in this room for ten days. My food supply ran out three days ago, and yesterday, I drained the last of my clean water.

Yet, in a bitter twist of irony, I find myself now understanding the deserter's plight:\\n\\nI do not fear wounds or bloodshed \u2014 those are marks of courage. I have long sought the glory of a valiant death in battle, as a symbol of honor. But... as one of the warriors of Kremnoan, sworn to \"better to die in battle than return even in glory,\" I must confess that, in this moment, I feel fear creeping in.\\n\\nThe Titankins out there were once paragons of glory and might, yet they've become tainted beasts, defiled monstrosities. As a warrior, I do not fear a heroic end, but I cannot bear to witness Castrum Kremnos, our sacred home, and the god we revered reduced to such undignified ruins.\\n\\nLastly, it's a relief to me that you chose to accompany His Highness to Okhema. It may not be as warm as home, but at least there's no black tide or these abominations.

Attendants are a little overwhelmed, and we are looking for stand-ins ASAP.\\n- Keep an eye out for clients from Kremnos and Ladon. They will try to find ways to start fires and burn offerings in the baths.\\n<i>- Is lighting fires not allowed? Or are Strife Rituals banned in general?</i>\\n<i>- Lighting fires is fine. But, they always throw weapons into the fire and the crackling sounds scare other guests.</i>\\n<i>-What if they insist? I wouldn't dare try and stop them.</i>\\n<i>- Call Daros, he has a way to stop them.</i>\\n\\n<b>2nd day of the Month of Fortune</b>\\n-The Starlight Pool is available again.\\n- Be aware that the number of Zagreus faithfuls is increasing by the day.\\n\\n<b><unbreak>10</unbreak>th day of the Month of Fortune</b>\\n-These guys' pranks are getting more and more extreme\\n- A client called \"Mr. Teaser\" says that he has a solution to this. He has requested to put on an event in the bath lecture area.\\n\\n<b><unbreak>16</unbreak>th day of the Month of Fortune</b>\\n- Mr. Teaser is banned from the baths.\\n- Borrow some soil from the dromas post to use as a temporary anti-slipping agent.\\n\\n<b><unbreak>17</unbreak>th day of the Month of Fortune</b>\\n- Mr. Teaser's friends are banned from the baths.\\n- Borrow some manpower from the dromas post and have them lead this herd of dromases back with them.\\n\\n<b>Month of Fortune day --</b>\\n- No, how could the water have caught fire!? And why is no one putting it out!?\\n- Have you never seen {RUBY_B#Leap Day}Spirit Day{RUBY_E#}?\\n\\n<b>1st day of the Month of Gate</b>\\n-Happy Month of Gate! Also, let us welcome our new attendants!\\n\\n<b>5th day of the Month of Gate</b>\\n- A new collection has been added to the repository as more non-bathing customers will be visiting.\\n<s><size=28>- Keep an eye out for the Kremnoans.</size></s>\\n<s>- You're just worried you can't beat them in a fight.</s>\\n- I will stress this again. Please do not leave the memos where guests can reach them.\\n\\n<b><unbreak>14</unbreak>th day of the Month of Gate</b>\\n- To new attendants: Though the baths do permit the observation of simple rituals, when an Oronyx's disciple asks about using the baths for divination, please make sure to ask about the precise details of this process.\\n- Okay... I'm a little curious as to why?\\n- Because the entire place will stink if cheese melts in the baths.\\n\\n<b><unbreak>15</unbreak>th day of the Month of Gate</b>\\n- Bath salts are only permitted inside the private baths. Xenia, please make sure to repeatedly remind anyone who buys bath salts.\\n- But no one has bought bath salts for ages.\\n- Not those ones, I mean the rainbow ones that have received the Benediction of Phagousa. The ones that make people jump all over the place after bathing in them.\\n- Got it. Is that where the hole in the wall came from?\\n- It is.\\n\\n<b><unbreak>22</unbreak>nd day of the Month of Gate</b>\\n- There is a disciple of Aquila that has not visited for a long time now...\\nYou mean the one that insists on washing their hair in the baths?\\n- Yeah. The one that insisted on opening a separate bath for the nymphs.\\n- If you mean the one that used a pair of silk gloves to tame the most ferocious dromas in the city, he volunteered to join the expedition team and attack the Black Tide. Unfortunately...\\n- May Thanatos bring him peace.\\n\\n<b>2nd day of the Month of Balance</b>\\n- To new attendants: Disciples of Phagousa make up the majority of clients within the baths. It is normal to find them in the corners, facing the pool and talking to themselves.\\n- But, the pool spoke back to them... Is that normal, too?\\n- Just stay out of it.\\n\\n<b><unbreak>10</unbreak>th day of the Month of Balance</b>\\n- There is nothing out of the ordinary today. I just wanted to ask... How about organizing one of the traditional events, like a treasure hunt again?\\n- We don't have the time or the people. If you want to do it, do it yourself.\\n-Alright, I'll do it.\\n\\n<b><unbreak>18</unbreak>th day of the Month of Balance</b>\\n- Just what is going on? How have all the guests ended up in a giant argument?\\n- If you want to blame someone, blame the guy that was chased out by the Mountain Dwellers.\\n- What did he do? Did he speak a Titan prayer or something?\\n- No. He just stood in front of the Spring Theater and shouted: \"Who is the greatest warrior in all of Okhema?\"\\n- I get it. The majority of Okhemans don't know the young master.\\n- This is what I'm always saying about you Kremnoans...\\n\\n...\\n\\n<b>Day \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0</b>\\n- May Kephale protect us.\\n\\n\u2014 Praise Kephale\\n\\n\u2014 Marmoreal Palace is back in business...

How can I thank you for your elegance and kindness? It was they, like messengers, who led me to your noble and pure presence.\\n\\nYour smile is like the sunlight of Lucid Hour, warm yet not scorching, holding a silent strength that softens the heart and stirs it with a quiet flutter.\\n\\nI never imagined that such a noble lady would take interest in my humble craft as a blacksmith. My trade, in others' eyes, is silent, dirty, and crude, but when you speak of forging, you are so focused, so skilled, even the automatic weapons of Kremnos you know by heart. We spoke from the bustling market to the point where even the most hardworking Chartonus began to feel drowsy. From then on, the moment of parting became a name \u2014 it is called Parting Hour.\\n\\nSurely you have many duties, and yet I find myself constantly thinking of you, often wondering if you are feeling weary or troubled. Though I know I, as an unknown man, may have no right to concern myself with your well-being, my heart urges me to boldly extend an invitation to you\u2014\\n\\nThe Marmoreal Palace is organizing a public holiday soon, with picturesque views and the sweet songs of nightingales. Perhaps here, you can find a moment to rest and momentarily escape your worries. Though my knowledge may not be deep, I am quite familiar with this place and its scenery. If you wish, three days from now, please allow me to be your guide.\\n\\nI wonder, though, if these words I have written now might cause you any disturbance... If this invitation seems inappropriate in any way, I hope you will kindly overlook it with a smile.

Though we have known each other for one hundred and one days and nights, such a precious gift still leaves my heart uneasy.\\n\\nPlease don't misunderstand, I do indeed cherish it \u2014 the splendid and vibrant gem, as red as the blood of a hawk, and the elegant, exquisite chain \u2014 it is just as I cherish you.\\n\\nI hope you will forgive this bold confession, even though I have told you this countless times already.\\n\\nAt times, in the quiet of the night, I still dream of that day in the smithy with you. My warrior, I saw you the moment I laid eyes on you. Even though you never ran in the arena of that fortress, I still recognized the courage in your eyes.\\n\\nAlas, when love runs deep, it is often tinged with sorrow. If tonight's dream brings me to you, I will be content. And if the black tide ever separates us, as long as you occasionally remember that I am here, I will still be content...\\n\\n<i>Yours sincerely, Nympha</i>\\n\\n\\n(...)\\n\\nMy dear Aelius, Please forgive my failure to meet you today.\\n\\nRecently, I have been frequenting the market, and although I have been cautious in my actions, it has still caught the attention of my parents. To avoid any unnecessary complications, I had no choice but to agree to attend today's civic court session with them.\\n\\nMy family has always been indifferent to the plight of the outlanders, and for a long time, I have refrained from involving myself in their decisions, for I disagree with their views. However... it is only today that I truly understood how extreme and narrow-minded they are, and my parents have not changed at all in the past twenty years.\\n\\nWhy must people hate each other because of their bloodlines? Why must we fight among ourselves? In these apocalyptic times, should the last city, Okhema, not be a refuge for all?\\n\\nBut my dear, no matter what, we will never be puppets of the grievances of the past generations. Our love is the will of Mnestia, and those who truly love will always be favored by the Titans.\\n\\n<i>Yours sincerely, Nympha</i>\\n\\n\\n\\n(...)\\n\\nMy dear Nympha, Regarding your previous suggestion, I have thought long and hard, and I have decided that I should speak with you face to face once more.\\n\\nCastrum Kremnos and Okhema have long been at odds, so although I know I will face cold stares and obstacles, I have never once held any ill will towards your parents.\\n\\nIn my humble opinion, rather than taking you away from Okhema \u2014 the last sanctuary of humankind \u2014 to venture into the unknown, where monsters roam the land, I would prefer to fight within the city, to build an achievement worthy of your name.\\n\\nPlease believe me, this is not out of fear \u2014 at least not fear for my own safety \u2014 but from a concern that I may not be able to protect you amidst the black tide and the monsters that lurk.\\n\\nI carry the bloodline of Kremnos in my veins, and once dreamed of returning to my homeland, believing in the ideal that \"it is better to die in battle than return even in glory.\" Yet, it is only after meeting you that I have come to understand that love is far greater than the death of honor.\\n\\nYour courage and determination are truly admirable, but please, my dear, forgive me \u2014 forgive this fool and coward, whose heart is filled with love, for not being able to bear any danger or harm that may lie close to you.\\n\\nSo please, grant me some more patience and trust. My beloved Nympha! Allow me to grow, so that I may be worthy of you \u2014 if we are indeed lovers destined by fate, Mnestia will surely watch over us!\\n\\n<i>Yours sincerely, Aelius</i>",

Everyone will chew on their bread, savoring the seven flavors gifted by Georios.</i>\\n<i>In the village, farmers still have the tradition of scattering their leftover bread in the fields, a prayer to Georios for a bountiful harvest of the seven grains in the new year. In Okhema and other cities, the residents have modified this custom, tossing their leftover bread into their potted plants instead. Regardless of their practices, the sowing work can only officially commence once this ritual ends.</i>\\n\\n\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Month of Joy: Phagousa's Laughter</align>\\nIngredients:\\n2 fresh fish (cleaned and sliced into pieces beforehand), <unbreak>500</unbreak>g of Spiraleye tentacles (cut into pieces), <unbreak>500</unbreak>g of starshells (cleaned), 2 tear onions (chopped), 4 cloves of garlic (chopped), <unbreak>100</unbreak>ml of olive oil, 4 wolfpeppers (peeled and chopped), 2 bay leaves, 1 sprig of rosemary, sale and black pepper to taste, <unbreak>500</unbreak>ml of Phagousa's fine brew <unbreak>500</unbreak>, 1 liter of rockspring water\\n\\nDirections:\\n1.

Add a whole bottle of Phagousa's fine brew, then add bay leaves and rosemary. Cook till the fine brew evaporates.\\n4. Add water, then wait till the broth boils before adding the Spiraleye tentacles, then cook for <unbreak>15</unbreak> minutes.\\n5. Add fish chunks and starshells, cook over low fire for <unbreak>30</unbreak> minutes, till the fish is fully cooked and the starshells have opened.\\n6. Add salt and black pepper to taste, then serve.\\n\\n<i>During the revelry in the Month of Joy, many in Okhema will gather in the city's public spaces and stew this giant pot of fish soup together. When the soup is done, remember to pour the first spoon of the soup onto the ground as thanks to Phagousa. When the appreciation ritual is completed, you can enjoy the fish soup.</i>\\n<i>During this time, remember to blow hard on the surface of the fish soup, to ideally imitate the sound of laughter. It is said if Phagousa hears enough merriment, they will infiltrate the crowd and bask in the feast with everyone else, afterward bestowing their mysterious graces upon all present.</i>\\n\\n...",
    "93849315": "<i>Editor's Note: It might be hard for Okhema residents to imagine that there were once some cities on the other side of the ocean, where the people there didn't think that the Titans were the pillars of the world. Instead, they believed that the Titans were controlled by an unspeakable higher being, a machine with divinity if you will, and manipulated by something as abstract as numbers. This editor is of the opinion that this heresy does not warrant any discussion, but since the blasphemy promoted the importance of numbers to this world to an unparalleled level, it does have some recording value as an anecdote. Therefore, this editor took the time to interview a certain foreign scholar seeking refuge in Okhema (name withheld for privacy concerns), and included two interesting foreign ideas for the readers to judge their value.</i>\\n\\n\\nNumerophile: Order\\nThe Order faction of the Numerophiles thinks that everything in this world can be reduced to integers and their operations. For example, they think that the Three Titans of Foundation ({RUBY_B#Sky Titan}Aquila{RUBY_E#}, {RUBY_B#Earth Titan}Georios{RUBY_E#}, and {RUBY_B#Ocean Titan}Phagousa{RUBY_E#}) are personifications of addition, the Three Titans of Creation ({RUBY_B#Romance Titan}Mnestia{RUBY_E#}, {RUBY_B#Worldbearing Titan}Kephale{RUBY_E#}, and {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#}) multiplication, the Three Titans of Calamity ({RUBY_B#Trickery Titan}Zagreus{RUBY_E#}, {RUBY_B#Strife Titan}Nikador{RUBY_E#}, and {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}) subtraction and division, and the Three Titans of Fate ({RUBY_B#Time Titan}Oronyx{RUBY_E#}, {RUBY_B#Law Titan}Talanton{RUBY_E#}, and {RUBY_B#Passage Titan}Janus{RUBY_E#}) logarithms and exponents.\\nAs mathematical research advanced and people realized that logic operations might be more basic than arithmetic, Order Numerophiles developed a new version of the Titan personifications: the Pillars represent conjunction, the Creations disjunction, the Dooms negation, the Fates exclusive disjunction. The attribution of the mysterious and seldom used exclusive disjunction to the Fate Titans might be the only intriguing aspect of this ridiculous theory, if it can even be called one.\\nGenerally, while Order Numerophiles' faith is questionable, they are excellent law-abiding citizens by Okhema standards. Should the readers encounter outlanders with such predilections, do not fret, as life in the holy city will guide them to eventually abandon their narrow views of the Titans, an unfortunate result of assessing the Titans with only one academic subject, and return to the right path.\\n\\nNumerophile: Chaotic\\nAs the name suggests, the Chaotic Numerophiles see integers \u2014 symbols of order in the eyes of the Orderly Numerophiles \u2014 as superficial, merely a byproduct of a deeper reality. They believe that irrational numbers represent the true essence of existence, with pi and base of natural logarithm possessing greater sanctity than the Twelve Titans. They argue that, just like the integers, the Twelve Titans are illusions created by natural structures. They propose the existence of a hidden, unknowable \"Thirteenth Titan\" behind the Twelve, one that is indescribable by either language or numbers and beyond human comprehension.\\nTherefore, we can actually see a paradoxical and interesting phenomenon here: On the one hand, the Chaotic Numerophiles deny the reality of all the Titans, believing that these living wonders are merely illusions to their senses. On the other hand, they believe in an unknowable {RUBY_B#The <unbreak>13</unbreak>th Titan}\"One True God\"{RUBY_E#} that grants the world chaos, from which order emerges. (Editor's Note: This is, of course, from their perspective.)\\nPlease be reminded: As proven by what happened to other cities, the Chaotic Numerophiles are often instigators of the worsening black tide. They do not revere any of the Titans that actually exist in the world, but absurdly believe in an non-existent so-called \"Thirteenth Titan.\" This arrogance and distortion that diverges from reality is precisely one of the major reasons for the constant strife in the real world. To all the good people of Okhema, let this serve as a solemn warning: Do not stray from the teachings of Kephale, and under no circumstances should you dare to defy the power of the Titans.\\n\\n",

Quickly blanch the large leaves in boiling water to soften them. Douse in cold water after removal, then drain.\\n4. Place a spoonful of the mixed ingredients on each leaf, then use the leaf to wrap them up as filling.\\n5. Add a little olive oil to a shallow pan, then lightly saut\u00e9 the wrapped leaf till both sides are slightly charred.\\n\\n<i>This dish was originally invented in the Grove of the Muses, the highlight of the annual celebration feast. During this evening feast, these Leaves of Wisdom were piled high as a mountain on a large plate for guests to use at their discretion.</i>\\n<i>What is worth mentioning is that only the scholars who achieved outstanding merits that year would be invited to the Grove's feast. Perhaps it is this reason that led people to believe that they would receive Cerces' guarded secrets if they also ate the Leaves of Wisdom.</i>\\n<i>What is interesting is that the Grove would stash bitter herbs randomly among the leaves. According to scholars who had the honor of attending, this was because the bitterness would stimulate the taste buds \u2014 they saw this act as an opportunity to spur thought and growth.</i>\\n\\n...\\n\\n\\n\\n<size=28><align=\"center\">\"Calamity Season\"</align></size>\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Month of Strife: Nikador's Shield of Victory</align>\\nIngredients:\\n<unbreak>500</unbreak>g of red wheat flour, <unbreak>15</unbreak>g of yeast, <unbreak>10</unbreak>g of salt, <unbreak>300</unbreak>ml of warm water, <unbreak>50</unbreak>ml of olive oil, <unbreak>100</unbreak>ml of Nikador's secret brew, <unbreak>100</unbreak>g of Nikador Fruits, <unbreak>100</unbreak>g of walnuts (slightly chopped), 2 sprigs of rosemary (remove leaves and chop them up)\\n\\nDirections:\\n1.

    "-1425180464": "<i>The following content is said to be an excerpt of a speech given by Robita, a priest of Oronyx, as they passed by Okhema. The specific year of this speech is unknown, and it may have been embellished or interpreted by later generations of priests. The theological interpretations of Robita's school of thought received mixed receptions from later generations and readers are reminded to approach their comments with a critical mind \u2014 Editor's note</i>\\n\\n(Preceding text has been lost)\\n\\nPeople often say that if Oronyx is just willing to offer their assistance, we priests of Oronyx are able to see any moment in time as we please... Many of my own seniors and new students even hold this opinion. However, this is unfortunately an incorrect view born of people's misunderstandings of the Titans.\\n\\nAlthough the Titans are indeed supreme beings, they are not omnipotent. The miracle of Oronyx is not to be able to directly \"see\" the past or future, but it is to be able to \"extrapolate\" them. Do not underestimate the importance of this distinction. In my opinion, if Oronyx was truly willing to help us predict the weather each day (or should I say, the tempers of Aquila)... Then there is a very real possibility that they could be mistaken.\\n\\nI know that people say that the prophecy of Janus can create endless paths and choices for humanity. Then, does it not follow that this would also be the same for Oronyx? This statement is actually half correct... Though the divinities of Oronyx and Janus bear some similarities, neither of them have any relation to \"directly interacting with the past.\"\\n\\nWhat Oronyx and Janus show their priests and allow them to interact with is not, in fact, reality itself. It is something that bears a great resemblance to reality. Perhaps this point is easier to explain in relation to Janus: Although we are able to select the \"history\" of something, that also means that in their eyes, that history cannot be true... It becomes a reason for something to \"gain or disappear from existence.\" This is clearly different to the idea of \"the past is the only true past\" that we have come to understand. The priests of Janus do not actually change the past, but they select a background or a \"state in which something exists now.\" In other words, what the Titans help us to change is current reality itself, not what has already happened in the past... Everything we see is no more than the process of rationalizing a \"changed reality.\" It seems to us like reversing the flow of time, but that is logically untrue.\\n\\nIf you can understand this, then it is much easier to understand the revelations (or dreams) of Oronyx: The reason that they refuse to tell us what the weather will be like the next day, (though they could easily ask Aquila and find out) the reason that they refuse to predict the lifespan and cause of death for the majority of the population is precisely because their divine powers are limited by being isomorphic with that of Janus. There is no way for them to predict such uncertain matters. <b>In other words, what Oronyx chooses to show us are parables that they are certain must have happened.</b>(Or \"absolutely will occur\" \u2014 tense has absolutely no meaning to Oronyx.) This makes the situation extremely easy to understand: What prophet would be willing to pronounce a prophecy that they themselves have no faith in.\\n\\nSo, if you have faith in my professionalism as a priest of Oronyx, I hope that you will realize one thing: Priests of Oronyx have already guided their divine power to the maximum potential. This maximum potential, if I were to describe it in blasphemous terms, is equivalent to placing Oronyx under house arrest. We give them no work at all. We simply allow them to focus on searching for truths regarding the past and future... These are all the results that can be gained. If Oronyx is not willing, (in my opinion it means that they have no faith) then they will not (in actuality, they are unable to) share any revelations regarding information on the past, present, or future.\\n\\nWhat you must all understand is that even the enormous power of the Titans has its limits.\\n\\n(Following text has been lost)",
