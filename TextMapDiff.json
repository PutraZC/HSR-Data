During the incident, the monocle fell from a height and was fractured.\\n\\n[Supplementary Testimony]\\nBohdan mentioned abnormal visual light emissions in the monocle during experimentation, resulting in a series of coincidences that eventually led to the Phlogiston leak.\\n\\nThe testimony was deemed inadmissible due to an excessive number of coincidences mentioned by the witness.\\n\\n[Additional Information]\\nSuspected as a premeditated criminal act. However, the cascading coincidences creating the Butterfly Effect did not constitute a reproducible criminal method, therefore this event was ultimately classified as an accident.\\n\\n[Recording]\\n<i>\"...This accident is actually a blessing in disguise, because it sent Lambda back to me again. Actually, this is our fourth remarriage... and it's a bit embarrassing to say, but this is MY first proposal for a remarriage.\" </i>Sourced from Bohdan.",
