Since the black tide's encroachment across cities, countless historical records have been scattered, and the Grove's scholars have had little time to collect all the documents \u2014 many lesser cities did not even get the chance to leave their names behind.\\n\\nOnly the wandering poet knows that the old city occupied by the evil dragon once possessed the esoteric method of alchemy: With flesh as the foundation, everything could be created, and miracles could be performed. The alchemists spoke as such to the king, heartbroken from the tragic loss of his beloved daughter.\\n\\n<i>\"Lament for my homeland...</i>\\n<i>The silver-tongued alchemist was confident he could resurrect the princess from the dragon's flesh.</i>\\n<i>What is dead, yet undead.

He sees the spectators starting to stand up from their seats, raucous applause and cheers riding through the air like a surging tide. At this moment, to his surprise, he discovers that the coliseum is extremely spacious, and the feeling of being unable to escape seems to have never existed. The center of the vast coliseum contains only blood streaks, the fallen opponent, and a solitary, shining victor.\\n\\nThe lord of the city raises his hand high, declaring him the champion. The booming of drums follows and he dons the wreath, becoming a legend of the coliseum.\\n\\n\"You have been chosen as the barrier troops commander attending to the lord of the city.

The soldiers firmly believe that Nikador's glory walks with him, and as long as he spearheads the front, the path to victory is all but assured.\\n\\n\"Henceforth, you are no longer needed as a warrior, but should become a symbol.\"\\n\\nThe body honed sturdy as rock over days and nights of strenuous training, now exists only to be admired like a temple statue.\\n\\nHe has been barred from the training grounds, for the soldiers mortally fear the slightest accident befalling this \"symbol of victory.\" He has been invited to the lord of the city's feast, where guests insist he regale them with the legendary tale of those sixteen fights to the death. Now, he has been stationed at the borders of the battlefield, holding a trumpet, his scintillating gold braces reflecting a profile growing ever more unfamiliar, and a sudden tightness grips his heart \u2014 he only has to blow on this trumpet, never needing to charge into the fray again... So, this is the \"A hero who wins without fighting\" of which people speak.\\n\\n\"...If this can bring victory to the army, I will voluntarily forsake my glory on the battlefield.\"\\n\\nNikador never chooses a path to victory for a \"symbol,\" so he dares not slack off \u2014 the final battle of his life may be upon him...",

This is merely what she heard from earlier bards, a poetic song imparted along generations only through words.\\n\\nIf no one passed down the songs, the history of the old cities would be truly buried in dust, and all would fade with time \u2014 The flourishing city-state of the past, deluged and devoured by the River of Souls, becoming a place disdained by even wild hounds and circling vultures.
