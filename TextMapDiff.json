And where should it go?\" Eleusis, the leader of the Ascetics, advanced north with his followers as he muttered this eternal question, seeking a sweet and frozen long dream. The robed ascetics settled in the desolate northern wasteland, building a solemn city-state where snow fell relentlessly all year round \u2014 A place later known as \"Aidonia.\"\\n\\nHow the Era Chrysea ended had long been lost to the annals of history, but the \"First Dead\" in Amphoreus was said to have come from Aidonia. That person received the gift of death from {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} \u2014 both a merciful blessing and the highest of honors.\\n\\nThe people of Aidonia were long accustomed to the harsh and lethal cold. The snow itself, long steeped in the silent faith of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}, also greedily absorbed the warmth of life as it soon touched the earth. Long ago, travelers entering Aidonia's demesne would often find anonymous frozen bodies lying dead by the roadside, unfortunates who had returned to the embrace of the {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Hand of Shadow{RUBY_E#}. The north wind howled, and the dead became markers on the road, guiding and warning those who journeyed through the snow. Travelers always hurried through Aidonia while the breath of life remained within them.\\n\\nIn time, the Aidonians came upon gravestones of mourning standing tall in the barren land, realizing that someone was offering their blessings to the cycle of death and the passing of life.\\n\\nBeneath the gravestone slumbers an unknown girl. A zone of death surrounds her like a shadowy shroud, and even the Skeletarasses that inhaled the breath of death withered away around her form. The Aidonians sensed the merciful touch of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} on her and welcomed her back to the city as their Holy Maiden. The faithful followers of the Death Titan, in reverence, emulated her, erecting towering gravestones in the wastelands to mark the end of long journeys and life's return to death \u2014 For life and death are both journeys, and this land only maintains boundary stones that recorded the paths taken.\\n\\nThe gravestones were warning distant travelers that no one stayed there and no one rested there... The dead, too, are travelers. They are the north wind, the falling snow, and the countless threads that connect them.",

The Ascetics of Lotophagism were captivated by the very patterns of the tree's leaves and flowers, believing that all life and even the cosmos were visible, tangible realities. Their practice was not merely asceticism for its own sake, but a method of harmonizing all things \u2014 seeing asceticism not as the denial of self, but as a direct path to understanding it.\\n\\nAnother branch bore heavy fruit, filling the boughs. Scholars of Caprism specialized in the study, breeding, and preservation of animals. The many forms of the chimeras, both pitiful and beautiful, were their small but meaningful experiment to understanding the vast diversity of life.\\n\\nOne branch twisted into a perfect proportion, precise and elegant. The scholars of Nodism asserted that \"all things are numbers,\" believing everything could be mapped mathematically. As one of the earliest schools to form in the Grove, they imposed strict standards, proclaiming \"No scholar who is ignorant of geometry may enter\" and regarded mathematics as the very means by which {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} governs the world.\\n\\nAnother branch grew thick and resilient, sturdy and enduring. Helkolithism required the scholars to prove their discipline by swinging a sling before admission, casting stones beyond a specific range. This was a test to demonstrate their commitment to \"perfectionism\" in thought, physical rigor, and competitive spirit.\\n\\nOne branch alternated between drooping and standing tall, transmitting an exquisite beauty to the senses. The Erythrokeramists view art and sensibility as the core of logical thinking, believing that the rawest and most refined knowledge comes from direct sensory experience, leading to a more enlightened and profound understanding of the world.\\n\\nHigh above, in the lush treetop, one branch devoted and worshipful stood closest to the heart of the giant tree. This branch was the most suited for ritual. The Venerationists excelled in the understanding of Titan ceremonies and the deployment of divine miracles, earning the nickname \"The Cradle of Amphoreus' Politicians.\" They not only governed the Grove's sacred rites but also influenced the very fabric of Amphoreus' politics. However, there was a new and sharp young shoot, rising in opposition...\\n\\nThe Nousporist inherited the First Scholar's teachings on the soul, and specialized in the transformation and ascension of life and matter. It was the youngest school, yet with the most cutting-edge arguments, focused on tracing the origins of all life and material existence.\\n\\nThe Seven Sages of the Seven Schools each presided over their respective fields of study, with no hierarchy among them. The towering giant tree of reason, the symbolic head of the Seven Sages, spread knowledge and reason like branches, scattering them across the world amid endless debates and intellectual discourse.",
    "1824416239": "Thalesus, the First Scholar, embarked on his journey around Amphoreus from his coastal home city, Mileutus, at his age of majority, seeking spiritual meaning within the Mnestia faith.\\n\\nAlong the way, his strange experiences and new visions reshaped his thoughts on nature and the origin of the world. At the journey's end, he met the Bough of Rift and completed his philosophical methods to experience the world before the great tree. Under the giant tree, Thalesus established a courtyard and named it the Grove of Epiphany, a place for people to awaken their spirits, seek wisdom, and grasp the way.\\n\\nThe thoughts of {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} became so enhanced that they became written scrolls or quietly turned into the whispering flora of the grove... The noise of the Grove was born from there. From these debates and intellectual exchanges, new schools of thought emerged.\\n\\nAlthough differentiated from one another, the schools were interwoven \u2014 much like the overlaying branches of the giant tree... Through centuries of argument and scholarly heritage, the First Scholar's insights have evolved into the Seven Sages and seven primary schools of thought, as well as many different viewpoints.\\n\\n\"All knowledge of the world should become the leaves of the Grove, to shield the sun and help the giant tree flourish.\" Every city-state seeking wisdom from the Grove must offer equal knowledge in return. Thus, countless ideas are nourished, and countless new leaves sprout.\\n\\nFor centuries, should any scrolls containing knowledge be found on trade caravans passing through the Grove's narrow passage or ships arriving at the port, they would become a part of the Grove's library regardless of the scroll's nationality or language. The scholars, or rather, \"bandits,\" transformed the Grove into Amphoreus' best school by ways of spending incomprehensible amounts of wealth on knowledge, hiring copywriters to steal knowledge, or even outright robbery of knowledge. The scholars of the Grove used questions as sacrificial vassals and thoughts as reverence, and bowed their heads at the supreme reason in this world.\\n\\nBeginning with the planting of life, returning to the spirit of the wood, the Grove collects all knowledge that flows to it from the world. {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} listened to the growing noise of the Grove, and never spoke.",
    "-97898222": "Once, an aggressive fool questioned the believers in Aidonia, unbelieving as to how there could be a religion in Amphoreus that reveres death. \"If you love {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} so much, why not just pierce your own chest with a spear?\"\\n\\nThe Aidonians regarded the man with disdain, saying, \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\"\\n\\nSince its founding, Aidonia has been a holy site that valued life the most out of all Amphoreus. The followers of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} believe that the River of Souls' waters are cold enough to chill the bones \u2014 only those who have walked the earth long enough and have endured countless hardships can cross its icy abyss and face {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. To seek the blessing of Death is not to disregard life.\\n\\nFor this reason, though the Aidonians considered death as a homecoming and gave birth to many fearsome warriors, they have never sought to conquer the fertile lands to the south \u2014 For those lands do not forge strong souls, and the Aidonians disdain the softness of comfort.\\n\\nAsceticism is a unique cultural hallmark of the Aidonians. Every year, when the snow subsides and the rare days of clear skies appear, they celebrate the Bone Collection Festival. Priests of Aidonia leave the city in search of animal bones buried in the wastelands and swamps. The most sacred offerings come from the remains of prehistoric beasts, long dead since many Light Calendar years ago. When their bones are struck, a deep echo seems to carry the faint whisper of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The animal bones, cold as if soaked in the freezing ice of the River of Souls, are transported back to the city one by one. The slightly broken ones get processed and become ornaments, to be worn by the people day and night. The best-preserved bones, on the other hand, are carefully polished by the priests into ceremonial bone swords for burials, offered as gifts during the festival.\\n\\nOne year, during the Bone Collection Festival, the Aidonians encountered that girl in the wasteland. Soon, rumors spread that \"her touch could allow one to cross the barrier of the River of Souls and directly face death.\"\\n\\nDevotees of Death flocked to the temple to meet the emissary of {RUBY_E#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The Aidonian priests, sensing that the girl threatened their faith, consecrated her as the Maiden of War, forbidding commoners from approaching her. Only those ascetics who had endured the trials of the world and revered both life and death were allowed to be embraced by her, and through her hand return their souls to the afterlife. The girl donned the long robes prepared by the priests, executed her ritual with her bare hands, and buried humankind with her embrace.\\n\\nThe Aidonians genuinely believe that \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\" Yet, the River of Souls does not question the weight of the soul. It simply flows, leading all life to its inevitable end, where all souls converge.",

The divine foal's mission is \"alliance.\" After successful crossing, the operator used Janus' authority to transport some supplies from the city and obtained extensive recorded information about black tide creatures.\\nThe route has been converted to regular status and will be maintained until the disaster ends or connection is lost due to force majeure.\\n\\n<b>IV.

The Temple of Fates has sent five operators in succession to locate the city-state, but due to Kremnos's mobile nature, the passage's connection remains unclear.

    "900418364": "<align=\"center\">Preamble</align>\\nIn the years that offers verifiable historical records, the study of Titans has become a prominent science and has continued to flourish. However, it seems that exploration into Cerces has never gone deeper than the surface level. As a Nousporist scholar, I must say that this phenomenon is ironic \u2014 that our research into reason lacks any depth of reason at all.\\n\\nIn my many years of research, I have noticed a phenomenon that is worth serious consideration: As the manifestation of reason, what Cerces themself displays are not purely logical characteristics, but a subtle duality. This duality is not only reflected in their choice of form, but also in the way that they influence the world.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">The Riddle of Form</align>\\nFirst, let us consider a question: Why would the embodiment of reason choose to descend to the world in the form of the giant tree? This choice in itself harbors a deeper meaning. There are many records of scholars' thoughts regarding this question in the ancient writings of the Grove of Epiphany. Some believe that this is a rejection of geometry, and some believe that this hints that logic must be rooted in reality.\\nAccording to records saved in the Library of Philia, Cerces first took root in the world right at the beginning of the Era Creatura. The world at that time was full of chaos and instability, yet Cerces chose to tightly intertwine themself with the earth through their roots. This choice insinuates that logic is not in fact above nature, it actually needs to grow in the soil of reality.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">The Dual Authority of Reason</align>\\nIn my research, I have discovered that the authority of Cerces actually consists of two seemingly contradictory aspects: Rational thought and procreation of life. This kind of duality has never been seen before in another Titan. When we observe the White Dryads of the Grove of Epiphany, this duality is particularly clear to see: They are not only capable of carrying out philosophical speculation but also maintaining the most primordial life force.\\nIn my recent research on the rings of the Sacred Tree, I discovered that the growth of its rings displays surprising order and regularity. This order bears a striking resemblance to the golden ratio summarized by ancient mathematicians. This seems to show that the foundation of reason comes from the observation of the laws of nature.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Unity of Knowledge and Life</align>\\nIn the history of the Grove of Epiphany, we can see how Cerces perfectly unifies these two seemingly contrasting qualities. They are both the guardian of knowledge and the nurturer of life. Whenever the sparks of inspiration burst forth in the Grove, the giant tree will condense dew to sustain new ideas. These ideas will be converted into nourishment to promote the growth of life.\\nOne particularly noteworthy idea is the Chamber of Purifying Tears's design. The traditional view is that cold aids in activating the brain and promoting thought. However, I have discovered through research that cold is a form of purification that allows those who seek knowledge to return to life's most basic and authentic state. This kind of ritualistic design perfectly embodies Cerces's dual attributes of reason and life.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Revelation</align>\\nThis discovery holds a special meaning in our current generation. When the black tide raged, and we were forced to leave our homes, pure rational planning alone would likely lead us to despair. It is just as I witnessed during my evacuation: Those who rely on reason alone will never get far, while those who listen to both the rational mind and the call of nature will often find a way to escape danger.\\nI will use the research of us Nousporists as an example: If we rely simply on cold alchemical calculations when seeking transformation from mortal to higher beings, we are doomed to failure. True transformation requires us to understand the duality of reason: It is the guidance to thought and the rhythm of life.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Conclusion</align>\\nThrough the research into the duality of Cerces, I have come to an important conclusion: Reason is not as singular as we commonly believe. It is both a method of thought as well as the rhythm of nature \u2014 the origin of knowledge and the impetus of growth. It is precisely this duality that has allowed Cerces to play such a unique role within the order of Amphoreus.\\nAs I write this manuscript, I cannot help but recall the White Dryads I saw in the Grove of Epiphany. As they unfurled their branches and leaves under the rays of light, they not only abode by the most rational rules of growth, but they also displayed the most natural form of vitality. Perhaps this is the most direct hint that Cerces has left for us: That true reason must coexist symbiotically with life itself.\\n\\n<i>(Note: Part of the argument in this manuscript is derived from the research conducted on the age rings of the Grove of Epiphany's Sacred Tree. My sincere gratitude to my Nousporist colleagues for their support and suggestions.)</i>",

All research is advancing as projected and we have no major concerns. I have been eating, sleeping, and living well. Fear not.\\n\\n       Though I do have one interesting story: the sisters Artakama and Cynane have taken to challenging me to battle in their spare time. What kind of Grove scholar would resort to the logic of fists over academia under the watchful eye of Cerces? What I did not expect was that these two actually have some skills! I hear that they possessed quite the arrogant temperament when they were young and often got into fights with neighboring children... You must not tell anyone that I told you this. I am so grateful that you taught me martial arts, otherwise, news of them beating me to the ground would have already spread across Okhema.\\n\\n       I also wanted to ask. Does the clothes that I sent to you last time still fit? The Lotophagists are making remarkable strides in their research and have recently developed a number of new fabrics from plant fibre. Their newest fabrics are stain-resistant while still being soft to the touch. There are a few tailors in the Grove who have some skills. I have asked them to put together a few outfits for you. Though I know you have no interest in extravagant clothing, the lace design on these items is a personal preference of mine. I'm certain you'd look wonderful in them... I hope you can forgive my selfishness.\\n\\n       It has been three years and seven months since I took up my post in the Grove, and eight whole years since the day we met. With our anniversary next month, I will apply for leave with my colleagues and return to Okhema to spend a few days with you. I know you have many affairs to tend to.

Can a Mountain Dweller guard who is renowned for being short of words take on the crucial role of commanding chimeras? We'll be watching eagerly!\\n\\n<b>Merchants Unite</b>!\\nThe merchants of Marmoreal Market also aspire to become chimera administrators! I wonder if these stall salesmen who excel in attracting customers and making small talk have what it takes to coexist with the chimeras and handle the role of administrator? Hmm.\\n\\n<b>The Bug Catcher Kid</b>!\\nI was just as shocked as you are when I discovered this, but this will make sense to you very soon \u2014 when it comes to communicating with cute little animals, is there any better candidate than an innocent child? A language barrier will never stand as an obstacle to communication for them. Children and chimeras are natural-born companions!\\nIf you ask me... It's the stern parents of such children who stand as the greatest obstacle to them becoming legendary administrators.\\n\\n<b>Priest of Cerces</b>!\\nThere's not much to say about this one. The Garden of Life has always had close relations with the Grove, which worships Cerces. It just makes sense that priests would get involved.\\n\\n<b>Administrator of Florie</b>!\\nI'll leave you on a little cliffhanger here...

What reason could we possibly have to turn them down? With Lord Mydei proving that he is a friend of all Okhemans, we are naturally willing to put our faith in this courageous and honorable community.\\nMy only hope is that they will not train the chimeras to become warriors like them...\\n\\n<b>A Dromas Keeper</b>!\\nIf you can raise dromases, naturally you will excel at chimera administration! The only question is: Isn't there a considerable difference in intelligence between dromases and chimeras?\\n\\n<b>The Bath King</b>!\\n... Another strange squad name. From the information I have received, this is a male administrator who spends their time at Marmoreal Palace year-round. His appearance is unremarkable to the point of being almost lazy and sloppy.

They turned sacred prophecies into tools of power, using the Holy Maiden's gift as a weapon against political rivals.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Corruption of Prophecy</align>\\nOn the surface, priests claim only offerings equal to one's request can prove a disciple's sincerity. In truth, the entire process of seeking prophecies has devolved into an intricate intelligence network:\\n\\n1. Information Gathering\\nThey established three levels of request offices, each staffed with dedicated priests who record clients' information and monitor lower-level priests' performance. Priests must document detailed backgrounds, relationships, and social status of all inquirers. Additionally, they maintain files on clients, regularly reporting to the highest-ranking priests.\\n\\n2. Priority Classification\\nWhen disciples come to seek prophecies, they are pre-sorted into three levels based on their questions and status. Priests schedule consultations according to priority \u2014 even if disciples have already offered tributes of equal value, unless... they pay more.\\nHighest Priority: Matters concerning city-state affairs.\\nSecond Priority: Major life decisions affecting daily life.\\nLowest Priority: Common folk's requests, usually rejected for \"insufficient devotion\" or delayed by \"priest under training.\"\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Desecration of Ritual</align>\\nMost appalling is their profanation of sacred ceremonies. Through long observation, I discovered the entire \"prophetic divination\" ritual has become an instrument of cruel oppression!\\n\\n1. The Holy Maiden's Cage\\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\\n\\n2. Environmental Control\\nAs for disciples... they never truly cared about them. The \"warm friendliness\" most followers witness is mere necessary pretense. The truth is far worse...\\n...The pervalent incense, claimed to soothe spirits and bring invigorating power, actually contains hallucinogenic ingredients. Had I not ground the incense myself, I'd never have discovered its contents.\\n...Prayer chambers feature unique acoustic designs, making priests' words create an illusion of \"prophecy\" when they talk. Not to mention window and lighting designs are made to cause specific visual confusion \u2014 even if disciples feel dizzy from the dome's focused light, they'd attribute it to \"divine might.\"\\n\\n3. Fabricated Prophecies\\nIronically, the Destiny Weaver manifests in reality \u2014 it seems the fate of believers, even city-states and the future itself, can be manipulated and fabricated by priests.\\nCertainly, I don't deny that the Three Titans of Fate's blessing grants priests and Holy Maidens glimpses of the future. But having the ability is one thing, and whether and how to use it is another.\\nJunior priests craft prophecy drafts, and mid-level priests adjust statement ambiguity, while senior priests ensure prophecies align with temple interests.\\nMy investigation revealed priests divided into three ranks. Ha, the number \"three\" appears everywhere \u2014 at least they're faithful to the Three Titans of Fate in this regard.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">[Handwriting becomes messy]</align>\\nI discovered more terrifying truths in the secret archives.

    "678443968": "(...)\\n\\nNext, I shall provide examples illustrating how different city-states' cultural customs influence local Titan mythology.\\n\\nA well-known mythological tale in Amphoreus tells of a coastal tribe in the Era Chrysea who suffered from tsunamis. Led by their chief, they built dams and dug channels to block the waves. This caught Phagousa the Titan's playful attention, who destroyed their work with giant waves. When the chief angrily questioned this, the Titan transformed into a great whale and proposed a wager: If they could cross the sea to a distant island within seven days, the Titan would cease troubling them and grant them their treasure. But should they fail, their coast would forever remain submerged.\\n\\nIn common versions, humans triumph because Aquila taught their chief to build rafts in dreams, with help from Georios on their journey. But in versions told in some coastal cities (like Aristia), Phagousa is the only Titan who appears: They teach shipbuilding to the chief as they are intrigued by a challenge from humanity and try to ensure fair play. Finally, they gave up being an obstacle for humanity due to being moved by human courage.\\n\\nCompared to popular versions, this portrayal of Phagousa shows more complexity and vitality. The divine-human connection strengthens, with more similarities in their personalities and behaviors. Given the various coastal city-states' reverence for Phagousa, I boldly hypothesize that, under the influence of different regional cultures, people unconsciously \"project\" their needs and desires, or the needs and desires of their group, onto Titans.\\n\\nI will now prove this point from a different perspective. It's well known that, among Zagreus's pranks done on the gods, the most famous is stealing Mnestia's offerings by hiding in the shadow of Mnestia's statue. In popular versions, there is a seemingly unimportant detail at the end of the story: Unable to catch Zagreus, Mnestia punishes their own priest instead, cursing him to never see beauty again.\\n\\nSuch a small detail sparked major debates many times among scholars and artists in the history of city-states like Aurelia and Milios \u2014 due to their different backgrounds, positions, and beliefs, people have different levels of acceptance toward this \"whimsical divine punishment.\" Some extreme Mnestia disciples reject it persistently entirely, violently declaring it \"shameful blasphemy against the perfect divine\" and consider the topic an unmentionable taboo on all ceremonial occasions.\\n\\nThe above is the foundation of the content that this book will now discuss in detail, which is the variations in Titan worship rituals in different regions \u2014 In other words, how people from different cultural environments conduct appropriate ceremonies to please the corresponding Titans based on their understanding of divine preferences and tendencies.\\n\\n(...)",

And such smooth, pure white petals! I will chalk it up to good fortune that I happened across it while it was bearing fruit. I swallowed the purple fruits with pleasure. The taste was extraordinarily sweet, and the aroma was difficult to describe. Unfortunately, a little while later, I started to feel unwell and my throat began to hurt. My head grew hazy like I had a cold \u2014 That's right. The winds in the garden have been so frosty lately.

    "1437958853": "<i>Author: Successor of the School of Nodism, Apuleius</i>\\n\\nThe School of Erythrokeramism has never published any monographs. This fact inevitably attracts criticism and means that the debate of \"whether Erythrokeramism should even exist\" has persisted since its conception. In light of this, I am writing this short article to analyze the rationality of the existence of the School of Erythrokeramism from the point of view of Nodism. This article will not contain any complex mathematical knowledge, so please read ahead without concern.\\n\\nLet us first recall the original purpose of Erythrokeramism's founding. It is said that the sage who founded Erythrokeramism summarized this as being: \"The information that we receive directly through our senses is the most pure. It is these materials that have not undergone excessive processing that form the most peaceful world we see.\" In other words, Erythrokeramism is in direct disagreement with Nodism and refuses understanding based on reason and the analysis of relationships between all things. They only examine the portion of the \"world\" that they can witness with their senses.\\n\\nIt is for this reason that critics often believe that Erythrokeramism must have the least value and validity in the eyes of us Nodists. It is also for this reason that people encourage us to \"make a proposal to revoke the rights of this school which wastes the Grove's resources.\"\\n\\nUnfortunately for these people, if we are talking solely in terms of academic value, the Nodist School does not agree with this perspective. To us, the Erythrokeramists happen to be an outstanding example: They strive to preserve human subconscious reactions to all things and use this to obtain a clearer recognition of the exact nature of our minds.\\n\\nIt is hard to expand on this without becoming overly abstract, so allow me to raise an example (or perhaps I should say tell a story). I once toured Okhema alongside Madam Socrippe of the Erythrokeramist School, and we had the following discussion:\\n\\nApuleius (Hereon shortened to \"A\"): Logical deduction is to all things, as the Worldbearing Titan raising the heavens is to humanity.\\n\\nSocrippe (Hereon shortened to \"S\"): I agree, as they are no more than castles in the sky.\\n\\nA: What do you mean by this?\\n\\nS: Though the Worldbearing Titan has lifted the clouds, the black tide still rages beneath them. The method they used to rescue us was to raise us into the sky for our protection. A castle can be built in the sky \u2014 they just require a ladder to be of any use.\\n\\nS: The same can be said for the views of you Nodists \u2014 you were fortunate enough to discover a number of eternal truths, so you cling to them. You believe that these truths will grant you spiritual safety in a world of constant change.\\n\\nA: Truth is truth, whether people cling to it or not.\\n\\nS: So truth to you is natural beauty.\\n\\nA: I would not deny that claim.\\n\\nS: Then, in my eyes, the Nodist School has done no more than imagine a new set of senses for themselves: Senses that see in greater detail than the eyes and hear more clearly than the ears.\\n\\nS: ...But frankly, I still believe this to be no more than a castle in the sky built to protect yourselves.\\n\\nA: What is it that we are protecting?\\n\\nS: You are protecting your minds by abandoning the sensory functions that the Titans gifted you. Your aesthetics are realized through fantasy \u2014 there is no such thing as a perfectly straight line or round circle in this world, just as infinity or negative values do not truly exist.\\n\\nA: It is precisely because these things do not exist in reality that we require them to comprehend reality.\\n\\nS: Then you are doing nothing more than walking backwards on a sphere. You took the longest possible route to arrive at a destination that would have been right behind you if you'd looked.\\n\\nA: You say that, but I do not believe that abandoning all thought will bring me peace.\\n\\nS: I am not asking you to give up on all thoughts. I am just suggesting that you listen to what it is that your senses are telling you. You must first be able to accept the existence of contradictions. That is the prerequisite for being able to appreciate them.\\n\\nS: ...Ah. Speaking in the manner of your school, just so you can understand me, is so exhausting.\\n\\nA: Oh? Then how would you express the perspective you were proposing in your school's words?\\n\\nS: If you were my student, I would have you sit here completely without thinking. You would use your eyes to listen to the sound of the wind and use your ears to savor the fragrance of incense.\\n\\nA: I don't understand.\\n\\nS: The world has never asked us to understand it. Your senses are capable of providing you with information that is far purer than any that your mind can distil. It's just that you have used thought to actively deny it.\\n\\nA: I do not think that these things that you are referring to can be subject to intellectual analysis.\\n\\nS: Oh, then congratulations! You have finally taken your first step towards understanding Erythrokeramism.\\n\\nS: That's right. It is precisely because \"intellect\" is not all-powerful that we need to remain wary and not allow it to believe itself omnipotent.\\n\\nS: People often say that intelligence makes one humble. However, I believe that this humble attitude is no more than another form of arrogance: It is precisely through this sort of illusion that we mistakenly believe that we can stand on the same platform as all supreme beings.\\n\\nS: To explain in the words of my school, your obsession with the concept of \"self\" is too strong. You consider the Titan raising the heavens extremely beautiful, so you imagine a cloud and place yourself shoulder-to-shoulder with them upon it.\\n\\nA: You cannot deny the beauty of the Worldbearing Titan. It is right there before your eyes. As for the clouds that we create, that is not imagination either. It is another form of reality.\\n\\nS: You are quite right. But you can still obtain inner peace without these creations. That is the essential difference between our two schools.\\n\\nConsidering that there may be some of you that were not able to fully understand this dialogue and what Madam Socrippe and I were discussing, allow me to provide a simple (yet not entirely accurate) translation: The reason the Erythrokeramists reject analytical thought is that taking a practical approach to life shows us that analytical thought is not omnipotent. There are too many kinds of knowledge in this world (in the eyes of the Erythrokeramists, art, emotions, and desires are all alternative forms of knowledge) that cannot be summarized through analytical thought. It is not that the Erythrokeramists cannot carry out intellectual analysis (as you can see in this recorded conversation, Madam Socrippe's analytical skills are on par with my own), but they refuse to use intellectual analysis to measure the world around us. Or, perhaps I should say, they refuse to reduce thoughts down to basic original knowledge (which is the core concept behind the Nodist School).\\n\\nThis is also why I will refer to this article as: <i>Foundations of Erythrokeramism's Theory of Consciousness</i>. To express this in the Nodists' phraseology: In order to expose the existence of the subconscious, the Erythrokeramists must confront the conscious mind head-on.\\n\\nIf the Erythrokeramists were to exist no more, no one in the Grove would ever follow this practice again.\\n\\nI hope that this view of mine has helped you all to understand the value of the existence of the Erythrokeramists (that is, if you truly cannot appreciate their works of art).",
    "678443966": "<b>To Codex:</b>\\n\\n       Forgive me for not being able to share my feelings with you face-to-face. I have noticed a lot of new faces among the Holy Maiden's guards recently. Though they have not started to limit my actions yet, they are flies on the wall that I am certain are reporting back constant surveillance to Dannalio and his followers. The majority of the priests and officials who I got along with have been removed from the temple and posted as envoys to other cities, and my contact with civilians is under strict control. Dannalio's party is clearly doing everything they can to weaken my influence.\\n\\n       Though I bear the lofty titles of High Priest and Oracle Maiden, I have no right to speak on most matters and am left with empty titles alone. If there are any officials or higher-ups in this great city of Janusopolis \u2014 the so-called origin of the tripartite prophecy and the holy city upon which the Fate Titans lay their gaze \u2014 who still hold devotion to the gods... I fear it is just the two of us.\\n\\n       ...\\n\\n      One more thing. In this time of war among the Titans, where Nikador has trampled Georios into the ground and hounded Aquila across the land, many people whose cities have been destroyed have travelled far to request a prophecy from us. I have looked into visitors we have had from the outlands over the past century and discovered that we have not received any envoys from the most distant city-states for some time. These cities would have been along the warpath of the savage god. I sought prophecy from the Titans and the response I received was... That these distant small states were annihilated long ago.\\n\\n       The Fate Titans revealed the name of the culprit long ago... The black tide. The destruction of these city-states was different to those destroyed by Thanatos or Nikador. Though these two gods are brutal and merciless, there would always be survivors left to weep for the dead \u2014 the entire civilization would not simply be wiped out overnight. However, with the black tide... It was as if the city-state was torn directly out of the ground of Amphoreus. Almost no survivors remain, except for the heavenly-blessed state of dragons and waves. That's why we have so many voices in this world that resent Nikador and curse Thanatos, yet very few report the devastation of the black tide. This bias has caused the various city-states to overlook the threat that the black tide poses.\\n\\n       What's more, I did some research on the warpath of Nikador, and there is one question that I cannot get off of my mind: In the past century, why is it that the Lance of Fury has seldom turned their destruction on city-states in the center of Amphoreus, and spent their time roaming those on the very outskirts? It is said that Okhema is under the protection of the omnipotent Kephale, but I have an absurd hypothesis... Nikador, the mad king and the savage god held in such disdain by the people of this world, is actually the guardian that protects us from the black tide. I fear this villain that destroys all city-states in their path is simply trying to drive people out of areas that are doomed to extinction, just like the story of the Mountainbreaker Geocles...\\n\\n       ...\\n\\n       There can be no doubt that it is just a matter of time until the black tide becomes the greatest threat to Amphoreus. However, looking at the chaos that Janusopolis has now descended into, I worry whether people will be able to regroup and face the threat of the black tide with the necessary tenacity once the Calamity Titans' threat pauses. The world needs the Holy Maiden of the Three Fates to guide its future. She must be the envoy that carries the true prophecy to rescue this world, not just a puppet used to placate the masses.\\n\\n       ...\\n\\n       Dannalio and the others are growing bolder in their actions by the day. I fear I do not know when they will make their move against me and Tribios. Of all the priests in the temple, you are the only one that I trust, Lord Acolyte. I am willing to entrust the authority to pass on the Holy Maiden's prophecy to you. In return, I would ask that you watch over Tribios should I ever become unable to care for her and create a hidden escape path inside our secret room in case of emergency.\\n\\n        May Janus reveal the path ahead for you, for me... And for this world.\\n\\n<align=\"right\">Mortis</align>",

As the morning dew condensed on the leaves above us, it would drip onto the pages of our books. I always believed back then that these water droplets must contain the sparks of wisdom, just as Cerces condenses every new thought into nourishing dew.\\nThinking back now, perhaps that dew really did contain some form of divinity. How else could we have enjoyed such wonderful moments inside the Grove for so long? How else would even the dullest of students have been able to gradually achieve enlightenment within it?\\n\\n<align=\"center\">The Final Lecture</align>\\nThe lesson that day was meant to be like any other. We were discussing the differences between the ideals of Erythrokeramism and Helkolithism at the Star-Chase Atrium, to debate whether sensory knowledge supersedes reason or whether reason births sensory knowledge.\\nSuddenly, someone shouted out: \"Look! Up in the sky! What is that!?\"\\nWe raised our heads to see that the stars in the sky had dimmed as if they were eclipsed by a layer of fog. Only later did we learn that this was the portent of the black tide's coming.\\nThe teacher calmly responded: \"...Everyone, we shall terminate our teachings for this semester here.

You followed the caravans to Okhema and said you would bring me back a copy of <i>On the Seven Emotions and Three Forms of Love</i>. But the black tide came too quickly.\\nNow, I finally understand why this place is called \"the Chamber of Purifying Tears.\" This pool is not only purifying my body, it is also washing away the sadness in my heart.\\nOh, how I wish I could taste your cinnamon rolls just one more time.\\n<align=\"right\">Your daughter, Elina.</align>\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Dying Ramblings</align>\\n<i><align=\"center\">Recorded from a dying White Dryad</align></i>\\n...They said that we would die, but how could a tree fear death? Our root systems are connected and our memories flow between us. Even if our branches dry and rot, the seeds of intellect will sprout again.\\nI remember the scholars who would come and go through this land. They would speak to us and see us as beings of wisdom. It was fascinating. They forget the wisdom of life itself in their pursuit of eternal knowledge.\\nWhen the black tide breaks us down, it is the youngest branches that wither first. This reminds me of the first lesson of Cerces: Reason must be rooted in the earth...\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Confessions of a Fugitive</align>\\nAs I escaped with all of the books I could carry, the Library of Philia had already been mostly overrun by the black tide. Those precious manuscripts dissipated into a cloud of black smoke in an instant.\\nI came across many other scholars who were trying to escape along my way. We supported each other and shared what rations we had remaining. When we were overwhelmed with fear, we would take turns reciting the content of the works we could remember, so we wouldn't lose the wisdom of the Grove.\\nAs we were running away from the Grove, it was with uttermost irony that we kept remembering the warning Thalesus shared in <i>Regarding Pilgrimages</i>: \"When you are chasing after the stars, make sure to pay attention to what lies underfoot.\"\\nPerhaps this is some kind of cruel joke of fate. Though we have come to this place to pursue knowledge, it is only when we are running for our lives that we finally come to understand the teachings of the sages that came before us.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Final Prayer</align>\\n<i><align=\"center\">A slate discovered next to a corpse</align></i>\\nOh, great Cerces! You have taught us reason and intellect, but never the terror of death.\\nAs the black tide devoured your roots, I saw the final leaf on your branches still trying to stretch out and reach towards the skies.\\nIf this is truly the end, please grant me your tenacity and allow me to think until my final moment.\\n\\n<i>Editor's Afterword:</i>\\n<i>As I was compiling these stories, I often found myself unable to stop crying. As each tear fell onto the paper below, it would cause the ink to spread into a small pool. It was as if those who had passed were still trying to tell me their unfinished stories.</i>\\n<i>However, I think that this is the final epiphany that Cerces has left us: That even in the darkest of times, the Coreflame of Reason will never be extinguished. If you are reading this in the distant future, please remember: The Grove was not merely a place that imparted knowledge to countless scholars, it is also a symbol of our ideals and beliefs.

My thoughts are beginning to grow blurred and blanks are appearing in my memory. However, these discoveries are far too important. They may have revealed the truth of what lies beyond the veil of Oronyx. I will attempt to use the last of my sanity to organize these notes.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Ceremony Preparation</align>\\nAs a Venerationist scholar, we are always studying various ceremonies that involve communication with the Titans. But, I wish to go one step further \u2014 I do not want to simply communicate with them. I want to observe them directly. Just how big is the Evernight Veil of Oronyx? What lies beyond it? Could that be the divine kingdom of the Titans? With the correct approach, I may be able to catch a glimpse of these secrets.\\n\\nAfter many years of research, I have discovered a number of key elements:\\n1. The Orb \u2014 There is some kind of power contained in the Oronyx Orb.\\n2. A set astrological alignment.\\n3. An ancient incantation that must be chanted in the correct tone\\n\\n<align=\"center\">First Attempt (Light Calendar Year <unbreak>3749</unbreak> \u2014 Month of Fortune)</align>\\nThe constellations are in perfect alignment tonight. After completing the purification ceremony in the Chamber of Purifying Tears, I began the first attempt.\\nI place the orb before my forehead and begin to chant. At first, nothing happened. However, I sensed something unusual after my seventh recital of the incantation. The veil seemed to pulse like a rippling water surface. What was even more unusual was that the starlight began to warp and form into patterns that I could not understand.\\n<i>(There is an ink smudge here as if the writer spilled their ink in a hurry.)</i>\\n\\n...\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Third attempt (time uncertain)</align>\\n(It looks like the records for the second experiment are missing)\\nI think I have seen something. There is something flowing in the gaps of the veil. It doesn't look like starlight. Could it be aether? Something more fundamental... They seem to be... hmm... I can't find the words to describe it. Any time I try to describe them, the words just crumble on my tongue.\\nInteresting discovery: When I stare at the flowing matter, my thoughts seem to flow also. The boundary between the worlds of the present and the past grows blurred. I saw conversations that had not yet happened and heard the voices of people who had long passed.\\nWarning: Do not try to record these scenes in words. Every time I try, the text simply \u2014\\n\\n...\\n\\n<align=\"center\">(Date unclear)</align>\\nSomething unexpected happened during today's experiment. When I activated three orbs at the same time, they broke and a huge explosion completely wiped out my laboratory. What does this mean? Is this a divine punishment of Oronyx? Did this happen because Oronyx is watching me and feels that my experiment has surpassed the rules laid upon mortals? Or could it be that the design of my ceremony was flawed and that caused the explosion?\\n\\nMy head is starting to hurt. My memory is becoming fragmented. I want to reorganize my manuscript. I remember I wrote down some numbers before... They were to do with the movement of the stars and other things... But there are only strange symbols on the manuscript now? They look like something I drew in my sleep. Just what on earth are they?\\n\\n<align=\"center\">(Date unclear)</align>\\nI have made a mistake. The veil is the divine realm of Oronyx. Mortals must not enter the divine realms of the Titans... What else was there? I don't remember. My head hurts.\\n\\n<align=\"center\">Conclusion</align>\\nTo \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, I don't think I can continue with this research.\\nDo not repeat my mistakes. There are some boundaries that must not be overstepped. I now understand why Oronyx created the Evernight Veil. It is the boundary that divides the sanity of mortals and the divine power of the Titans.\\n\\nI have begun to doubt my existence. As I write these words, who is it that is moving my hand? When I reflect on such questions, who is it that is moving my thoughts? We believe that we are observing destiny, but perhaps we are the ones being observed... It is Oronyx that is observing us ridiculous mortals!\\n\\n<i>(The next few pages are littered with indecipherable symbols and chaotic lines. Occasionally, you can make out a few words:)</i>\\nOronyx is looking at us\\nMortals!\\nGet out of here\\nYou should not investigate the divine power of the Titans, and their divine power cannot be observed\\nI am not real who am I what am I am \u2014\\n\\n<i>(The final page contains only a note in shaky handwriting:)</i>\\nForgive my transgressions, O Veil of Evernight...\\n\\n<i>(Note: This manuscript was first discovered in a secret chamber in the Grove of Epiphany's Library of Philia.

    "-2097493556": "I don't know how long I have left to live. I see the black tide flowing into the temple. This place is going to be reduced to rubble, and I am old and feeble. Before I die, there are some things I feel that I must get down in words. I'm not trying to beg for some kind of useless forgiveness \u2014 I just don't want to leave this world harboring secrets. I don't want to go into the River of Souls bound in chains of shame and watch myself sink into the murky waters never to achieve release.\\n\\nIt's been fifty-three years.\\n\\nI have spent the majority of my life in Janusopolis. I worked my way up from being an ignorant trainee priest to a high-ranking position in the priesthood. Now, I am just an old man hiding in a ruin. When I was young, I always thought that I was doing some kind of holy duty and devoting my life to serving the Titans. Looking back now, I realize that I was just another mortal driven by greed.\\n\\nOr, perhaps, our actions are inherently blasphemous against the Titans. No, perhaps \"blasphemy\" is the wrong word... What we do is more complicated than that. I still remember... When a young Holy Maiden first entered the Hall of Prophecy, she really could sense some kind of power. I've seen it many times now: Their eyes glaze over, their bodies begin to shake gently, and their mouths begin to spout words that even they don't understand. This is a true prophecy \u2014 whispers that come from the other side of the Gate of Infinity. However, these kinds of prophecies are vague and hard to comprehend. They are full of contradictions. It is this lack of clarity that gave us room to interpret their meaning.\\n\\nIn the beginning, we were simply... Tweaking them slightly. Much in the way that a gardener would prune a bush, we would gently trim away any untimely parts of the prophecy and stress the warning signs that would be beneficial. Who could say that this was wrong? A chaotic prophecy would only cause panic after all, while a prophecy that has undergone some organization can guide people.\\n\\nHowever, power is a strange thing. It can make you believe that you are doing the right thing until it's too late for you to change. Gradually, we were no longer satisfied with simply changing prophecies. We began to filter the Holy Maidens and search for those candidates that were more obedient and more willing to listen to our \"guidance and opinions.\" We would put medicines in their food and drink and say that they \"would aid in meditation.\" Finally, we even began pre-preparing prophecies ourselves for the Holy Maidens to read out during ceremonies.\\n\\n...\\n\\nI remember a young girl named \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. She was the most talented Holy Maiden I had ever seen. There were times when I began to suspect that one of the Titans was actually projecting through her... But her prophecies were always untimely: She would prophesy peace when we needed war and warn of disasters when we coveted stability. The other priests grew most displeased with her because of this. At that time, I thought that I was protecting her. I taught her how to give the \"correct\" prophecy. Thinking about it now, perhaps she was trying to save us \u2014 but we turned down this opportunity time and time again.\\n\\nA prophecy should be the true words of the gods, but we changed them into our own personal instructions. In truth, what we did was even more subtle than that. The \"prophecies\" that we created were just like a mirror. They made it easy to see whatever it was you wished to see. When a priest is expecting a prophecy of war, any light breeze can be interpreted as the sound of a blade slipping from its sheath. Perhaps we were not counterfeiting prophecies, but merely choosing to hear what we wanted.\\n\\nThe most ironic thing is that even manipulated prophecies would sometimes reveal the truth. There was a ceremony in which \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 seemed to have lost her mind and started screaming in insanity: \"The abyss is opening its jaws! The holy city will be devoured in black water!\" In that moment, we thought it was just meaningless ramblings. Looking back now, perhaps the Titans had never left us. We just could no longer hear them.\\n\\nI often wonder if Janus had been watching over this whole situation. Had the god behind the gate of destiny been mocking our arrogance this whole time? We thought that we were weaving fate. In fact, it was fate that was weaving the ridiculous lives of us mortals.\\n\\nIf you ask me, the future that I saw \u2014 the coming of the black tide \u2014 may not have been a punishment at all. Perhaps it was a release. It has washed away all of the lies that we carefully constructed to make us face the truth of this world.\\n\\n...\\n\\nI bumped into a number of familiar faces in the reflection room at the back of the temple. I still remember how they would dote on me back then... The beautiful jewels, the stacks of gold that would stretch out my silk purse... And all my favorite things from Okhema and Castrum Kremnos that they'd managed to get their hands on in one way or another and gone through hell to have delivered to my room. In what feels like the blink of an eye, these Holy Maidens are all old ladies now, but their eyes are clearer than ever. Strangely, when we spoke about the past, they didn't seem to hate me at all. \"Prophecies are naturally chaotic,\" they said, \"perhaps no one can ever understand the will of the Titans.\"\\n\\nThat's how it is. Though prophecies are chaotic, the food, clothing, and authority of the Holy Maidens were precisely controlled by mortals.\\n\\nI can see my chances of survival slipping away. The terrifying black tide is growing ever closer. Though no one can see it, it is as clear as day in my pupils. I don't know why, but I feel a sense of calmness. Perhaps this is my final prophecy: After destruction, a new truth will be reborn.",

Recorded by: Nousporist scholar Herodotan \u2014 Light Calendar Year <unbreak>4919</unbreak></i></align>\\n\\nSince the establishment of the Grove, scholars have maintained a level of restraint when it came to debates and disagreements. After centuries of maintaining this balance, a debate erupted that became a matter of our survival or extinction. The cause of this debate was the balance between reason and faith. A portion of the scholars believed that the Grove should act purely in pursuit of knowledge. Others argued that scholars must not deviate from their reverence of Cerces. The debate intensified by the day, as scholars from each school eventually split into seven independent groups, each operating independently in separate areas of the Grove.\\n\\nThe Lotophagists moved from the Courtyard of Storge to a remote forest, the Caprist scholars led their beasts into seclusion, and the Nodist mathematicians even claimed that they would leave the Grove to find a \"pure land that had not been tainted by idiocy.\" Seeing this paradise of intellect about to be divided, each school had no choice but to meet and discuss a countermeasure.\\n\\nAfter three months of constant negotiation, the seven schools finally agreed to hold a conference in the Star-Chase Atrium. The conference continued for a full seven days. According to the records from the time, the first day of discussion almost spiraled out of control. The Venerationists persisted in their belief that all research should be completed with reverence for the Titans at its core. The Helkolithists on the other hand disputed this, saying that excessive reverence would impede the search for truth. The Erythrokeramists went on to criticize the other schools for \"stifling the freedom of artistic expression in the name of reason.\"\\n\\nThe dispute persisted until the fourth day, when a rare lightning storm hit the Grove by surprise and the scholars were forced to move to the Library of Philia to rest and seek refuge from the rain. It was during this tea break that the scholars began to reflect on one question: Why would Cerces choose to come to earth in the form of a tree?\\n\\nThe Caprists pointed out that trees need to be rooted to the ground as well as growing upwards towards the sky. They must follow the rules of growth whilst adjusting to the changes in their environment. The Nodist mathematicians added that the form of a tree itself contains a most strict mathematical structure. The Lotophagists on the other hand reminded everyone that the growth of a tree is dependent on sunlight, rainfall, and nutrients from the soil, much like knowledge requires various sustenance to grow.\\n\\nBy the sixth day, the various schools finally reached an accord regarding their management structure: The establishment of the Seven Sages system would allow each school to maintain their independence while simultaneously keeping each other in balance. However, debate regarding the candidate for Head Sage led to an unprecedented stalemate.\\n\\nEach school insisted that their beliefs were closest to the ideals of Cerces: The Nousporists placed importance on seeking out the true nature of life itself, the Lotophagists maintained the importance of cultivation of body and mind, the Caprists advocated returning to nature, the Nodists held watertight logic in the highest esteem, the Venerationists emphasized divine rituals, the Helkolithists sought perfect balance, and the Erythrokeramists stood in defense of artistic freedom.\\n\\nThis debate endured an entire day and night. People proposed all sorts of solutions: A rotation system, a parliamentary system, and someone even proposed a lottery system. However, there was no one solution that could satisfy everyone. Just when the stalemate reached its pinnacle, a single leaf fell from the sacred tree and happened to land in the center of the conference table. This sight reminded the scholars of an ancient proverb: Cerces once said that the roots of the tree of reason are just as important as its branches. If one end is neglected, the entire tree will wither.\\n\\nAfter a long period of silence, someone proposed an idea: As no one can represent Reason itself, why do we not leave the seat of Head Sage permanently empty as tribute to Cerces? This proposal spread throughout the venue and gradually gained favor. Not only would this gesture show reverence to the Titans, it also serves as a reminder to all scholars: No one should try to overstep the authority of Reason themself.\\n\\nBy the sixth day, the various schools finally reached an accord regarding their management structure: They established the Seven Sages system to achieve balance in the Grove. The Seven Sages were not merely leaders. They were also a carefully constructed management system.\\n\\nAt this point, the Seven Sages each took charge of the seven major roles within the Grove:\\n1. The Nousporism Sage was responsible for reviewing experiments and research to ensure that investigations would not endanger the Grove itself.\\n2. The Lotophagism Sage managed medicines and meals to maintain the physical and mental health of the various scholars.\\n3. The Caprism Sage would oversee the forests and the beasts to balance the boundaries between nature and humankind.\\n4. The Nodism Sage took responsibility for books and documentation to ensure the preservation and passing on of knowledge.\\n5. The Venerationism Sage managed important ceremonies to maintain the connection between the Grove and the Titans.\\n6. The Helkolithism Sage supervised physical training to cultivate the practice of unifying the mind and body.\\n7. The Erythrokeramism Sage took charge of artistic education to nourish the growth of the soul and the senses.\\n\\nFollowing this, they established a strict system of rules:\\n1. Each Sage can serve for only seven years, and their role cannot be held repeatedly by a scholar of the same school.\\n2. An important decision requires the agreement of at least five Sages.\\n3. If any experiment or research involves three or more different schools, it must undergo joint review by the relevant Sages.\\n4. Each Sage has the right to veto dangerous behaviors within their school.\\n5. If a Sage neglects their duties, the other six can unite to impeach them.\\n\\nFinally, they established a succession system to ensure that the system can be passed down properly:\\n1. Each Sage must raise three candidates for their succession.\\n2. The successor must obtain the approval of at least four other Sages.\\n3. Successors of seats in other schools must learn from each other's areas of expertise.\\n4. The successors must live together for one year inside the Library of Philia to nurture a mutual understanding.\\n\\n<align=\"center\"><color=#dbc291ff>As for the seat of Head Sage, it will forever be reserved for the sacred tree and Reason themself.</color></align>\\n\\nAt the end of the protocol agreement, the seven schools wrote a concluding remark: \"We pursue knowledge, but do not overstep divinity. We respect faith, but do not deviate from reason. Just as the roots of the sacred tree intertwine, intellect and reverence too must complement one another.\"\\n\\nIt is clear from the subsequent influence it has had that the Protocol of the Seven Sages not only ensured the free development of academic research but also maintained checks and balances between the various schools. Even more importantly, it sets an example for future generations: True intellect is derived from the fusion of diverse influences, not from a singular supremacy. It was the equilibrium ensured by this protocol that allowed the Grove of Epiphany to maintain its vitality in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n<align=\"center\"><color=#dbc291ff>Attachment: List of Current Seven Sages in the Grove</color></align>\\n\\nLotophagism: Medea\\nCaprism: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\\nNodism: Apuleius\\nVenerationism: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\\nHelkolithism: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\\nErythrokeramism: Socrippe\\nNousporism: Anaxa",

Instead, do some basic stretches to stimulate blood flow. After getting out of bed, wash your face with cold water, say your prayers, practice thought training, and have your first meal (only eat until about <unbreak>70%</unbreak> full). Contrary to popular belief, the time between waking and eating is the best time for abstract thought. Intense exercise is not recommended.\\n\\n2. Lucid Hour\\nThe time of the day in which people are most talkative and quick-minded in disputation. As a scholar, one should actively take part in academic activities and research discussions (make sure not to be seated for too long; it is better to freely switch between sitting and standing). Team sports such as beast ball, smash ball, and stickball can also be organized during this time as a change of pace (as well as entertainment).\\n\\n3. Action Hour\\nAction Hour is the time of day when everyone's brains begin to slow down and the time comes to charge your energy and engage in physical activity. After eating your second meal and resting for twenty to thirty minutes, you can begin jogging (please make ample preparations before exercising!) Those with extenuating circumstances can swim instead of jogging. This can reduce the damage to joints caused by exercise. (<b>Note: Do not disregard jogging entirely for this reason. Jogging is the best form of exercise, second only to swimming. Joint damage is never an excuse not to jog.</b>)\\n\\nThere is no set requirement for the distance that you jog or swim. Generally, when you feel that you cannot continue any longer and must rest, then rest for five minutes before continuing. (<b>Note: Do not take excessive rests</b>). We recommend keeping your total exercise duration within one hour. If you happen to have a form of manual work that can replace this form of exercise (such as transporting packages etc.), then taking part in this kind of manual labor is also a good option.\\n\\nIf you have no plans during Action Hour, such as conducting experiments, attending special training, joining social events, or personal recreation, you can begin a muscle strength training regimen straight after the aforementioned cardiovascular exercise program is complete. Strength training is best completed 2\u20134 times a week to maintain the explosive power of your muscles and prevent deterioration. Furthermore, participating in the various team activities mentioned above is also a good option.\\n\\n4. Parting Hour\\nHaving completed the harsh training of Action Hour, now is the best time to enjoy your third meal of the day. Make sure you don't push your final meal of the day back to Curtain-Fall Hour every day! Eating too late in the day will place a heavy burden on your body and halve the effectiveness of all your exercise.\\n\\nAfter finishing your third meal, if you have already completed a considerable amount of exercise during Action Hour, you can use this time to engage in personal recreation activities. If not, this time should be used to supplement necessary daily exercise (such as those for cardiovascular function).\\n\\nGaining muscle is about persistence \u2014 no one is capable of perfectly planning their time without interference from external factors, and everyone feels lethargic from time to time \u2014 the key is learning to coexist with these inevitable factors. Therefore, do not feel like just giving up because you were not able to exercise during a set time, and do not push all of your projects back to the end of the day and deal with them then. I can tell you from experience that exercising with others is the easiest way to nurture good habits. What's more, this also makes it easier for you to participate in group activities that are more interesting than solo ones.\\n\\nIn short... Be sure to make lots of friends while you are exercising!\\n\\n5. Curtain-Fall Hour\\nThis is the time for sleep. You should not engage in any activities other than sleep during this time. Remember: Staying up late will greatly decrease the effectiveness of all the exercise you do and make the next day that much harder, adding all kinds of unnecessary risks and strain.\\n\\nIf you are unable to avoid staying up late, then it is best to sleep in and not force yourself to get up early.",

The Nodist School aims to cultivate students with a solid theoretical foundation and are capable of utilizing absolute rigorous methods of inference to study the relationships between all things, as well as to measure the quantity of all things, their structures, the spaces they exist in, and the changes therein.\\n\\n2. As the school with the longest history in the Grove of Epiphany, scholars have access to priceless knowledge that has been handed down through the Nodist School over millennia. This knowledge is built on a basis of a very small and necessary number of foundational facts, and employs strict tautology to eliminate all\\n\"self-evident truths\" that may create misconceptions.\\n\\n3. It is for this reason that although our school may revere the Titans in daily life and honor the morality of Amphoreus, when it comes to research, we refuse to discuss them without rigorous consideration. We discourage anyone who would use this as an excuse to indulge in excessive vapid discussion without engaging in the work of academia from joining.\\n\\n4. Our school maintains the belief that, as a theoretical pillar, mathematics is a science that examines the relationships between all things in this world in an absolute and rigorous manner. We welcome all seniors, fellows, and students who also hold this opinion of mathematics.\\n\\n5. This school does not set any form of standardized assessments. That being said, in order to ensure that no one's time is wasted, we hope that you will consider your ability to answer the following questions before contacting us:\\n\\n1. Why is it that the conclusions reached by mathematics can be deemed worthy of the name \"truth\" when those of the other schools can only be referred to as \"knowledge\"?\\n2. Why is it that even the great and mighty Titans are forced to obey the laws of mathematics?\\n3. Why is it that we say that if the world were to have a foundational language, then it must be mathematics?\\n4. Why is it that people say the divine authority of the Titans can be changed as they please, but the conclusions of mathematics could not possibly ever change?\\n5. Why is it that it is not just numbers alone, but the concept of infinity (infinitely small, infinitely large, infinite distance) can also become objects of study for mathematicians?\\n6. Why is it that the seemingly objective study of mathematics is a creation of the subjective will in humanity and Titans, and also cannot ever be separated from it?\\n7. Why is it that (6) and (1) do not contradict each other?\\n8. Why can 1+1=2 be completely proven with just a single sentence?\\n9.

Yet, the encirclement of the black tide around it has become unmistakably clear.\\n\\nFor a thousand years, wherever the black tide has swept, life has been twisted into inhuman monstrosities, and city-states have been eroded by the wind into desolate ruins. Even a stronghold like Kremnos saw its gods tainted by the black tide, leaving nothing but wastelands in its wake.\\n\\nMost of the Coreflames had been restored, yet as the black tide approached, we found ourselves desperately short on time. All we have achieved will have been in vain should Okhema fall before the Era Nova.\\n\\nThe author boldly speculated that, soon, the heroes chasing the flame would inevitably face a decisive battle against the black tide. Historical records showed that even the most valiant warriors could not endure long within the black tide. Among the Chrysos Heir heroes, if there was any hope for this battle, it would either rest upon the fearless Phainon or fall to Mydeimos.\\n\\nThis wasn't merely because Mydeimos hailed as the bravest in this world, carried a destiny that defied death, nor was it solely because the old city of Kremnos occupied a strategic choke point against the black tide. Even though Mydeimos, like the lion of Kremnos, had migrated countless times in his life and ultimately settled far from his birthplace, the solitary king would never submit to foreign rule. Once he had settled his people, Mydeimos, who regarded his mission as his very essence, would undoubtedly return home. Yet, this time, he bore not only the hopes of the Kremnoans but also the future of the entire world.\\n\\nTalanton's priests once prophesied that the millennium of Strife that started in Kremnos would also find its end there.

Over approximately nine years, they reforged themselves no less than ten thousand times, ultimately tearing apart a giant monster, staining the sea red for miles, yet no flesh-eating sea creature dared approach.\\n\\nLegends speak of how that the king of the seas could sweep countless fish and shrimp onto the shore with a flick of the tail.

Two days ago, I found out about how they wished to blaspheme Nikador with your life. But by then, you were already imprisoned, and even my frantic attempt to escape with you was too late. If I fail to convince your father \u2014 my husband, Eurypon \u2014 tomorrow, I'll launch a challenge to the crown, using gladiatorial combat to save you from his grasp. I'm not fully confident of my chances... but as your mother, I'm prepared to risk everything and sacrifice my own life, even dragging Eurypon with me into the depths of the River of Souls, if need be. When the throne stands vacant and chaos reigns in Kremnos, you can trust the protection of Krateros. He's my chosen guardian. You must treat him as an elder, and he will respect you as a king.\\n\\nMydeimos! Do not forget your father, Eurypon, even if you forget me, never forget that despicable king. We once vowed to terminate the tradition of patricide to usurp authority that sullies Kremnos in our era. Yet, along the journey, his greed and evil overwhelmed him, causing him to sacrifice even the honor of Nikador and tarnish Kremnos. Mydeimos! Do not follow in your father's footsteps!\\n\\nMydeimos, I still remember how your cry was so fragile and ethereal. Eurypon and I could never have imagined that such a feeble cry would come from our child. But when Nikador's battle cry resonated through the Soul-Forging Gate, echoing, the sound of your cry suddenly became crystal-clear resonant as the roar of the Tretos lion. There was no denying it: you are of pure Kremnoan blood, the son of {RUBY_B#Founder of Kremnos}Gorgo{RUBY_E#} born to take the crown!\\n\\nBut Mydeimos... I'm afraid your journey ahead is, starting tomorrow, fraught with hardships. I never thought I would be able to survive beneath the blade of the king of Kremnos, nor will I ever accept sitting by while Eurypon plans to take your life. Should that happen... you'd be orphaned, perhaps banished from Kremnos, forced to wander alone, forever branded with scars and blood.\\n\\nMydeimos... If this must come to pass... Then, as your mother, I wish you won't have to be the son of {RUBY_B#Founder of Kremnos}Gorgo{RUBY_E#}. You are simply the son of {RUBY_B#Queen of Kremnos}Gorgo{RUBY_E#}, the ordinary child of a Kremnoan mother. If you develop yourself with determination and eventually claim the title of champion or warrior, then I will be pleased even in the afterlife. However, if you have doubts about this so-called glory, then live as you please! Gorgo, the founder of Kremnos, per their will and their yearning, summoned Nikador and earned the glory of Strife. And you, my child, can also return home with true glory under the radiance of the Lance of Fury...\\n\\nMy dear Mydeimos...\\n\\nMydeimos...\\n\\n<align=\"right\">Gorgo</align>",

When crisis struck during Phainon's Coreflame trial as we waited anxiously, we made the snap decision to join Castorice and Mydei in rescuing Phainon from possible peril.\\n\\n{NICKNAME} and I became separated in this illusion. {NICKNAME} told me that {F#she}{M#he} travelled with Mydei and had seen the man's deepest fear, which was the blood-soaked glory of the Kremnos. As for me... I saw some visages of past lives too. Who would have thought that the trial of Strife would be a battle against your inner demons? It seems that {RUBY_B#Strife Titan}Nikador{RUBY_E#} is not the mad and tactless god told in legends.\\n\\nWe finally met up in the illusion of the trial after some fighting and found Phainon by following the sound of battle to the source of Strife. The man had almost lost control of himself due to the demons in his heart, and we saved him and extracted him from the trial. The failure of Phainon's Coreflame trial means the responsibility of bearing Nikador's divinity now falls to the lone crown prince of Kremnos \u2014 Mydei the Chrysos Heir. Yet, even as the orthodox heir to \"Strife,\" Mydei seems to have an absurd extent of hesitation and objection to accepting the god's authority.\\n\\nAfter ensuring Phainon's safety, {NICKNAME} and I retreated to the bath chamber to rest. We also drew our own conclusions about the present situation in the world of Amphoreus: The development of this world is entirely too bizarre. Neither the Titans nor the black tide seem like characteristics that should be present in a culture that developed organically. However, various signs point to the Stellaron not being the mastermind behind it all. The puzzles in this world require more \"trailblazing\" to explore and reveal.\\n\\n...\\n\\nAglaea demonstrated genuine gratitude towards us for helping to defeat Nikador. She prepared a generous gift and invited {NICKNAME} and I to a discussion at the Hero's Bath, where she indicated she would like to ally with us. As we discussed the matter, we met Hyacine from the Twilight Courtyard, a healer who had concluded her work trip in Okhema. With Aglaea's suggestion, {NICKNAME} and Castorice decided to go back to the Grove together with this new friend and complete the diplomatic tasks given to them by Aglaea. I will, instead, stay at Okhema and tidy my notes. However, this trip to the Grove by {NICKNAME} is not as peaceful as we had imagined.\\n\\nAs they were about to head out, Trianne found someone at Okhema's outskirts who was wounded by the black tide and in critical condition. Hyacine had to temporarily remain in Okhema to look after this patient while Trianne, Castorice, and {NICKNAME} went ahead to the Grove of Epiphany, an esteemed academic institution worshiping {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#}. However, when the three of them arrived at their destination, the Grove had long sunk into an eerie silence. {NICKNAME} and the others took some effort to enter the Grove only to discover that something was wrong in that place \u2014 The creatures of the black tide were wandering everywhere within the Grove.\\n\\nI fear that the Grove is unlikely to survive unscathed after this calamity. A man named Anaxa was among the Chrysos Heirs stationed at the Grove, and he had left clues via alchemy and guided {NICKNAME}'s group into the depths of the Grove to check on Cerces's Coreflame. While they explored the location, they encountered a mysterious individual calling themselves Calypso. That person claimed to be the head of the Grove of Epiphany's Seven Sages and had saved Anaxa. However, after careful observation, Castorice exposed Calypso's true identity as {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#}. Cerces admitted to this and asked {NICKNAME}'s group to help them reach Anaxa, so they could fuse the Coreflame again to catch the culprit behind the annihilation of the Grove \u2014 the nameless black-robed swordmaster.\\n\\nAfter an intense battle, {NICKNAME}'s group safely returned to Okhema with Anaxa, and I learned about what happened at the Grove from Phainon. In fact, Phainon seemed rather odd when he mentioned that black-robed swordmaster. It was as if he had some history with that individual. Perhaps he will explain that connection to everyone in the future.\\n\\n...\\n\\nI can hardly believe it, but a Kremnoan named Krateros abducted Trinnon and tried to enter the Vortex of Genesis to accept Strife's trial. He failed and was apprehended on the spot by Aglaea. No wonder Mydei had been so hesitant on the subject of accepting the authority of Strife \u2014 Troubles remain within the Kremnoans as a people. Troubles that have not been solved. As to what those troubles are, I fear only Mydei would know. Meanwhile, despite being abducted, Trinnon expressed her understanding towards Krateros's anxiety. She decided to borrow Oronyx's power to restore Krateros' memories from ages past to soothe his unease.\\n\\n...\\n\\nWhile at the Abyss, the three Tribbie ladies encountered the black-robed swordmaster who destroyed the Grove \u2014 the Flame Reaver. At the cost of exhausting her divine power, Trianne sent Tribbie and Trinnon away from the battlefield. The heroes in the city then met up, after which we decided to split up. Hyacine and I went to look for Trianne's whereabouts, while Aglaea and Castorice remained in the city to prepare for a political crisis. The others prepared their strategies and headed to Castrum Kremnos to stop the Flame Reaver together. The Chrysos Heirs must all give their all when facing this unknown foe.\\n\\n...\\n\\nDuring this time, Mydei finally made up his mind and successfully passed the trial of the Coreflame, ascending into the demigod of Strife and making a lance throw that decided the battle's outcome at Castrum Kremnos, defeating the Flame Reaver completely. This campaign ended with the Chrysos Heirs' triumph. Mydei opted to return home alone and inherit the duty of fighting back the black tide from Nikador, becoming the shield for Okhema and all of Amphoreus.\\n\\nThough we won the fight against the Flame Reaver, we have lost Trianne forever. At Trianne's funeral, Phainon made a request to Tribbie, hoping to witness the moment she first embarked on her Flame-Chase Journey. With the power of {NICKNAME}, they journeyed to the past of the Abyss of Fate \u2014 to the sanctum of prophecy, Janusopolis. There, they witnessed how Tribios took the Coreflame of Passage, received Janus's divinity, and fled this Sanctum of Tripartite Prophecy that had held her captive for decades to pursue her destiny.\\n\\nI'm not sure whether they were influenced by the beliefs of the Chrysos Heirs, but {NICKNAME} and Mem have volunteered to accept the trial of {RUBY_B#Time Titan}Oronyx{RUBY_E#}. Though they are just passersby, they are willing to connect their destiny with that of the world they are travelling through. Perhaps this is trailblaze's inescapable fate...\\n\\n...",
